sorry, couldnt answer right away

siste Choco, i became a Christian very recently, about half a year ago JESUS saved me, praise KING JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH! ‚úùÔ∏èüíó

the story is something like this: i was at that point in life doing the second year of univesity, and for quite some time i had just a profound sense of meaningless of life, i was having all those existential questions like why are we here, what are we to do here, whats the purpose of it all, stuff like that. and i even started looking into some philosophies. i tried reading something on Stoicism and even practicing some of it, and probably it helped a little to be a bit calmer perhaps, but it didnt give me no answers to those questions.

and so then i remember, which now looking back is definitely GOD reminded me, of a few conversations we had with our grandpa who was suggesting we read the BIBLE, and at that time when those conversations took place, a few years ago definitely, i was just completely almost hostile to that idea, you know? no wonder. and so i wanted to try looking into that.

from that point i really dont remember all the details, i dont know if it was a few months where i was discovering Christianity or if i was saved at one point, but definitely somewhere between October 2023 to February 2024 im pretty sure i was saved. some moments from that period i remember is starting to actually believe there is a GOD, not sure how that quite happened, sorry. then also one bit turning point was when i saw some testimony on youtube about hell, it was something like an hour and a half long and it was very vivid and very detailed depiction of what hell is like. from a Christian standpoint of course. and so after watching that i was just literally shaking of fear and trembling i think and wondering what can i do to avoid that place

and then, this very well might be the point when JESUS saved me, one very scary situation happened to me some night. i dont remember the date, nor what was happening with me during those days, but it went like this: i was sleeping and i remember having a dream of some bald skinny creature sitting at my legs literally in my bed reaching out with its hand and trying to tickle me or reach down to my stomach, something like that. it giggled after it tried reaching and i woke up almost immediately. that was most definitely one of the scariest moments in my life. that dream felt real, its as if it literally been there, sitting at my legs on my couch at night.

after i woke up, this is nothing less than a miracle, i prayed the entire LORD's Prayer, never having memorized it, i never prayed it before, i dont think i even ever read it before, but right at that moment after waking up from that horrible dream i prayed that prayer. no doubt it was the HOLY SPIRIT giving me the words, and i think from that moment i was saved.

i can be sure of that because for a few months, or maybe one month, but quite a long time i was going around the neighborhood just smiling, praising GOD in my heart and just overflowing with joy. it was very amazing, praise JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS ‚úùÔ∏èüíñ

yeah, thats briefly how JESUS saved me from hell ‚úùÔ∏èüíû HALLELUJAH THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. and i pray and hope that all who ever read this get saved also, because this is the most amazing thing ever: knowing that you will spend forever with the most Awesome HOLY GOD ALMIGHTY who created heaven and earth ‚úùÔ∏èüíìüôèüèº

and of course after i was saved i think i just started eating the BIBLE completely, i read the whole BIBLE in a very short time i remember
