**Not to us, O LORD, not to us,
But to Your name give glory
Because of Your lovingkindness, because of Your truth.
Why should the nations say,
“Where, now, is their God?”
But our God is in the heavens;
He does whatever He pleases.
Their idols are silver and gold,
The work of man’s hands.
They have mouths, but they cannot speak;
They have eyes, but they cannot see;
They have ears, but they cannot hear;
They have noses, but they cannot smell;
They have hands, but they cannot feel;
They have feet, but they cannot walk;
They cannot make a sound with their throat.
Those who make them will become like them,
Everyone who trusts in them.**
	
**O Israel, trust in the LORD;
He is their help and their shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD;
He is their help and their shield.
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD;
He is their help and their shield.
The LORD has been mindful of us; He will bless us;
He will bless the house of Israel;
He will bless the house of Aaron.
He will bless those who fear the LORD,
The small together with the great.
May the LORD give you increase,
You and your children.
May you be blessed of the LORD,
Maker of heaven and earth.**
	
**The heavens are the heavens of the LORD,
But the earth He has given to the sons of men.
The dead do not praise the LORD,
Nor do any who go down into silence;
But as for us, we will bless the LORD
From this time forth and forever.
Praise the LORD!**
— Psalm 115

**Praise the LORD, all nations;
Laud Him, all peoples!
For His lovingkindness is great toward us,
And the truth of the LORD is everlasting.
Praise the LORD!**
— Psalm 117

*Shepherd the Flock of GOD*
**Therefore, I exhort the elders among you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion, but willingly, according to God; and not for dishonest gain, but with eagerness; nor yet as lording it over those allotted to you, but being examples to the flock. And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. You younger men, likewise, be subject to your elders. And all of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, for God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.** 

**Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on Him, because He cares for you. Be of sober spirit, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. But resist him, firm in the faith, knowing that the same experiences of suffering are being accomplished among your brethren who are in the world. And after you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, strengthen, confirm, and ground you. To Him be might forever and ever. Amen.** 

**Through Silvanus, our faithful brother as I regard him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and bearing witness that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it! She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, sends you greetings, and so does my son, Mark. Greet one another with a kiss of love.** 

**Peace be to you all who are in Christ.**
— 1 Peter 5

**Do not boast about tomorrow,**
**For you do not know what a day may bring forth.**
**Let a stranger praise you, and not your own mouth;**
**A foreigner, and not your own lips.**
**A stone is heavy and the sand weighty,**
**But the provocation of an ignorant fool is heavier than both of them.**
— Proverbs 27:1-3

**Better is reproof that is revealed**
**Than love that is hidden.**
— Proverbs 27:5

**A prudent man sees evil and hides,**
**The simple pass on and are punished.**
— Proverbs 27:12

**He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning,**
**It will be counted as a curse to him.**
— Proverbs 27:14

**Iron sharpens iron,**
**So one man sharpens another.**
— Proverbs 27:17

**As in water face reflects face,**
**So the heart of man reflects man.**
**Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied,**
**So the eyes of man are never satisfied.**
**The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold,**
**And each is tested by the mouth that praises him.**
**Though you pound an ignorant fool in a mortar with a pestle in the midst of crushed grain,**
**His folly will not turn aside from him.**
	
**Know well the condition of your flocks,**
**And pay attention to your herds;**
**For wealth is not forever,**
**Neither is a crown from generation to generation.**
— Proverbs 27:19-24

**An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous,**
**And he who is upright in the way is an abomination to the wicked.**
— Proverbs 29:27

Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully matured, it brings forth death. Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers. Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow. In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.
— James 1:12-18
