Daddy Jesus thank You for the morning Father GOD
we been on discord quite a bit lately and i think it was a mistake, we should repent
we been talking to a lot of people and that just makes us more worldly Daddy Jesus please help us LORD 
we should take a little break and slow down and think, why do we want to talk on discord
same problem just different means now: lust for entertainment
we are bored so we go around those discords 
literally the name of the app says that it's there for division wow 
LORD Jesus please help us quit it Father GOD 
in Jesus Holy Name we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY ‚úùÔ∏èüíñüôèüèº 
AMEN 

also we should probably research this lust for entertainment thing Daddy Jesus please help us Father GOD

Daddy Jesus i really don't get how people make atomic notes and how that can be useful at all
YOU helped us organize our files very nicely and to color code them Daddy Jesus thank You LORD GOD ALMIGHTY 
but yeah those files will most likely not gonna be used much
i don't wanna offend YOU Daddy Jesus and i don't wanna throw You out of the picture Father GOD 
i wanna explore some different topics but in all of them there are prayers to YOU FATHER GOD 
i cannot live without You Daddy JESUS, literally
whom are we doing it for? and what would be our reason? 
are we doing it for people? then of course we shouldn't do it at all
are we doing it for God? then we should do it properly
what im talking about is i wanna create a vault that would be completely atomic and rely on those links
but yeah i have no idea how to do it Daddy Jesus please teach us if You wanna 

HALLELUJAH THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS. JESUS helped us get started with that little [BIBLEkasten](https://github.com/seesmof/BIBLEkasten) vault and it actually works pretty well, GOD helped us see connections that we wouldn‚Äôt have saw otherwise. i think, GOD willing, we will continue experimenting with that thing, and GOD knows, maybe it will turn out to be something useful and interesting ‚úùÔ∏èüíû thank YOU JESUS! lets go try evangelizing now FATHER GOD, right?
