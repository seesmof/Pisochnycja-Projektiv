hiya matey. just came back from the market journey with my mom, our family tradition by now, and it was quite alright. ive also set up this upper section with my global and daily tasks, quite useful. and so yeah, the walk was quite alright, but i need to gain some strength, cause the heavy bags still kinda wear me down a bit, so i need a better overall strength. but generally the day is going quite alright, very boring so far, but its fine. im currently researching different system prompts and adding them to Custom AI prompts. ive also created a group list in the 121 University Year Two Term One, quite useful. and so the prompts thing is quite exciting, i will be adding to the AI Conversation Log regarding not using shampoo while showering|Shampoo usage argument since i just had an updated response from the AI with the new 18-in-1 prompt that i set as a custom one. ive also downloaded a browser extension called [Superpower GPT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/superpower-chatgpt/amhmeenmapldpjdedekalnfifgnpfnkc) and its quite useful as well, since it allows for selection of different profiles of custom prompts. i think i also wanna tweak the personal prompt in custom ones and pretty much use it throughout all the profiles. but yeah, let me update the AI Conversation Log regarding not using shampoo while showering|Shampoo usage argument and i will be back to you. not sure what i have planned for today, maybe ill watch some movie today, not sure yet. cya later, pal.

oh yeah, and i just remembered that its our cousin's birthday, so gotta create a 2023 cousin dasha birthday greeting and greet her. not sure what social media she uses, but hopefuly she is in the telegram. okay, once i finish reading and researching the AI Conversation Log regarding not using shampoo while showering|Shampoo usage argument, i will get to that. i think today i also wanna get to filling in my military library and exploring different kinds of military stuff, as its quite interesting to me. so yeah, that sounds like a plan for the day, alright good luck, have fun.

okay, i think ive pretty much settled on the decision of continuing not using shampoo while showering. i discovered that the shampoo was first invented for cleansing some heavier materials or pollutants that won't come off as easily with just water, and it also provides some aesthetic benefits like better hair quality, it becomes more fluffy and velvety, and as i dont really care about that, i will just continue using only water for my everyday showers. okay, now that that is done, we need to congratulate our cousing Daria with her 15th birthday. i will utilize AI for that as well, of course. after that i wanna dive into Sanskrit and learn what it is, cause i heard the term before, but i wanna know more. and after that i will start filling out my military library and gain knowledge on different technologies that world militaries used and use to this day. okay, later. current task: 2023 cousin dasha birthday greeting.

okay, coming up with the birthday congratulation was much more difficult then i could ever imagine it to be, but i think i nailed it, here are the two final versions we ended up sending her. me and Kate, my sister i mean.

kinda cringe, but its alright i think. 

okay, change of plans, i think i wanna dive into Ace Combat 7 once again. downloading it now. to play it i of course need a controller, but the adapter i have needs some kind of special drivers, cause it does see the controller, but wont connect to it. so now wanna try to look for the Bluetooth adapter drivers and then enjoy some nice little Ace Combat 7 action. last time i played it i really enjoyed the Korean F-16 planes, im pretty sure it was called something like K-2 SDK or K-2A or something like that, dont wanna look into it now, but yeah. will play for a while and will see how it goes then.

okay, no i will continue with my prior plans of investigating Sanskrit and then moving on to military stuff. im interesting in Mitsubishi F-2 Japanese aircraft, thats what it was, not Korean. okay, lets go.

hiya, doing quite alright now, just chilling. completed all the stuff i wanted to. decided not to get into military stuff, cause thats a lot of work and im feeling lazy, so i decided to take on Chrome extension development for opening ChatGPT, yep. And now gonna go ahead and do that. wish me luck and cya later.

greetings! 18:22 on the clock, Fedya started his stream and tells that he is gonna be having a game day, which, a game day, if you've forgotten, is on Saturdays when we play games together, he and his viewers. And so now im on a new system, as you know, and i dont have no games in here. I just couldn't be bothered downloading them. But i am downloading Fall Guys right now cause that game is pretty fun for me and I'd like to play it on the stream. So right now its on 30% already, but it cut off all my other traffic and sucks out almost all the internet and i can just see the chat, the stream is buffering all the time and the music stopped. But i hope it will not last much longer as i've already donwloaded 3.2 out of 5.7 GB required. I've also been watching a bit about 9/11. I dont remember what exactly got me watching it, but I watched. Oh, no, hold up, I do remember. I just saw a random youtube recommendation where some guy compiled a synchronized footage from 4 TV media outlets from that day from those moments on September 9th, 2001. And it is completely devistating and horrifying to see, obviously, cannot even imagine what people in the buildings and on the ground not far away from it felt that day. Extremely disturbing, and i just realised that i know almost nothing about it, so i will definitely dedicate some time today to Learning about 9/11 and all the events that went on that day. I will most likely do that later today, probably closer to the evening, so expect me there later. But for now I will wait for the Fall Guys to finish downloading and go chill there for some time. Cause Fedya's streamers are less frequent with each day and each stream feels like a kindof big deal to me, especially the saturdays which are usually our game days, not always though. And fall guys is a very memorable game for me, so why not chill there for some time. Obviously it won't be long, since neither i can play for too long now, nor Fedya will have time for much of Fall guys as he has other games he wants to play on the game day. my music just continued playing which means that the game has officially installed, just as we were speaking. So now i will go ahead and hop into the stream to see what's going on there. but knowing Fedya and his organisation, quote unquote, i doubt we will go playing for some more time, so i'd have to entertain myself for that time somehow. i quit nutting, gotta admit that, because parents just went outside to walk the dog and usually what would happen in such times would be me going to the toilet and busting my nut, but not anymore, because i've identified that this behavior is harmful for me in the long run and so i decided to not do it anymore. so yeah, thats it for now, i think, let me check on the stream and i will come back to you later today. Cya

wanna explore how the softbox (?) works. not sure if its the actual name of it, but will create the page anyway. here we go - [[Exploring how the softboxes work. so my theory regarding its construction was just confirmed by Fedya. i got curious only cause Fedya had it and apparently had some issues with it. and my theory was that this is just bulb, surrounded by a light —Ä–æ–∑—Å—ñ—é–≤–∞—á, which is called diffuser. so yeah, just a bulb on a pole with light diffuser white material surrounding it. it is directional and here's how it looks.

hiya. sitting here watching the stream of Fedya, and playing fall guys from time to time. but now is a little gap. so the mood is quite alright, the parents and Kate just came home and mom's gonna make me some tea. but just chilling for now, listening to some chill music.

Good evening, mate. Just watched a video i some great Ukrainian guy who talked about how to improve memory. He was talking about journaling, which is already tremendously helpful, but he had a whole system in mind that will gradually improve i memory as we go and complete it. But before I dive into the details of this system, what it consists of and how we can implement it, excuse me for just a second as I need to attend bathroom real quick. Be right with you in a sec. Okay I am back. I've also went ahead and refilled my water supplies so I've officially completed this day, all the tasks I wanted to complete were indeed completed and even though I haven't coded today, apart from creating that chrome extension, but that's not really coding, that's just copying stuff, I believe this day to be productive and I'm glad I spent it the way I did. That is definitely not time wasted, so gotta give props to you. And even though typing on the phone is extremely painful, I will still complete this entry and tell you about the method I was proposed by this random nice guy on the Ukrainian YouTube. So, let's talk about the method first and then we'll be able to implement it right there in our second paragraph, so stay tuned for that. So, the main instrument is journaling, of course. Which, like I said, already in itself brings a lot if benefits to our lives, but it goes deeper than that. So it is practically divided into certain stages. On each stage the practice is the same - you sit down and journal trying to remember past events and actions. Then, on the next morning you reread everything you wrote previous day. But as you continue doing that you need to increase the interval between your entries. Your ultimate goal is to journal once per 10 days and being able to recall everything that happened in those 10 days in the past. And you can clearly see what benefits such practice can bring. But to get there, to that ultimate goal you need to do it gradually. Cause you won't be able to just remember everything for the last 10 days just like that right off the bat. And so what you need to do is gradually increase the interval between your notes. At first it's 2 days, then 3, then 4 and so on until 10. You get the idea. So I'm not entirely sure about the idea of journaling like that, periodically, but considering the fact that throughout this almost a full year of me writing in my journal, I took way longer intervals between entries, so I think we should give it a shot anyway. It's gonna start off from journaling everyday, of course, so that's a perfect plan for us to both develop a habit and increase and improve our memory. My neighbor from above is being extremely disgusting by shouting some nonsense, but this continue for quite a while now, I can't even recall for now many years. And in the ideal world I would've solved it right away by just going to him and telling him to shut the fuck up or else I'll kill his entire family, or something along those lines, but considering how much of an NPC pussy I am, I will never do it, I don't have the gut to confront people and tell them what I really think. So I just conform and adapt to fit in and tell people what they wanna hear, that's my strategy of survival. So my best bet here is to just move out. But obviously I don't have any place I can move out to nor do I have any money for that so I guess we'll stuck with what we have for now. 

Okay, let's not test out the proposed methodology by trying to recall our actions i the day without reading our notes, just purely using our memory. Actually, should I go from most recent events or from the oldest ones? Not sure, but we'll go from the oldest ones for now. 

I woke up at around 8 am, after sleeping for about half an hour more from the point when my alarm went off at 7 am. Oh it's one and a half hours you moron. I don't even remember when my alarm is set on to. Okay, then I booted up my PC and started testing out the supposed auto gpt system prompt for chatgpt that I think I saw yesterday and wanted to test out. Or not that, I don't remember. Then my mom brought me some pancakes with jam as she always does on Saturdays as my little breakfast, and a cup of tea. Karkade. Then I went to have a cold shower, as always. I don't use shampoo anymore and today was no exception, but I did brush my teeth in the bath tub. When I came out, I also left my previous pair of shorts there since mom prepared me new ones, she told me to brush my teeth, but I told her that I already did in the bath tab. Coming back to my room I rubbed my body with a towel I was wearing and dried it out as much as I could before taking red panties from the drawer, putting them on with a black t shirt from goldi, not a v neck but with a little cut out at the front, and my shorts, the ones with big pockets. After that I wrote a shopping list in obsidian before browsing a bit more of YouTube, don't remember what I was watching, and moving out to our regular weekly market raid. Oh man I have no more energy nor will to continue writing. The crazy neighbor is yelling and it's disgusting and unbearable so I'll just go to bed. Good night. I'll do the experiment starting from tomorrow.
