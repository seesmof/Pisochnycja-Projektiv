> [!bible]+ Genesis 12:13
>  **13** Please say that you are my sister so that it may go well with me because of you, and that I may live on account of you.‚Äù

> [!bible]+ Genesis 20:2
>  **2** And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, ‚ÄúShe is my sister.‚Äù So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.

> [!bible]+ Genesis 26:7
>  **7** Then the men of the place asked about his wife. And he said, ‚ÄúShe is my sister,‚Äù for he was afraid to say, ‚Äúmy wife,‚Äù <i>thinking</i>, ‚Äúlest the men of the place kill me on account of Rebekah, for she is beautiful in appearance.‚Äù

JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
JESUS this is very interesting
three times now i think YOU talk in the Book of Genesis about how some patriarchs presented their wives as sisters
JESUS this is an amazing lesson showing us that even the best of saints still fall short 
and yet YOUR Grace Father GOD is enough for us all
JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
AMEN

> [!bible]+ Genesis 28:20-27
>  **20** Then Jacob made a vow, saying, ‚ÄúIf God will be with me and will keep me on this journey on which I am going, and will give me food to eat and garments to wear, **21** and I return to my father‚Äôs house in peace, then Yahweh will be my God. **22** Now this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God‚Äôs house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You.‚Äù

JESUS im sorry please forgive me
JESUS if that makes people uncomfortable im sorry
JESUS i just wanna be pleasing to YOU FATHER GOD
JESUS please help us LORD 
JESUS i just wanna give everything away
JESUS please help 

JESUS we just thought of some BIBLE verse about how there's a time and a place for everything
JESUS i think we just mixed it up with two verses from Ecclesiastes

> [!bible]+ Ecclesiastes 3:1-8
>  **1** <b>A Time for Everything</b><br/>There is an appointed time for everything. And there is a time for every matter under heaven‚Äî **2** A time to give birth and a time to die;<br/>A time to plant and a time to uproot what is planted.<br/> **3** A time to kill and a time to heal;<br/>A time to tear down and a time to build up.<br/> **4** A time to weep and a time to laugh;<br/>A time to mourn and a time to dance.<br/> **5** A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones;<br/>A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing.<br/> **6** A time to search and a time to lose;<br/>A time to keep and a time to throw away.<br/> **7** A time to tear apart and a time to sew together;<br/>A time to be silent and a time to speak.<br/> **8** A time to love and a time to hate;<br/>A time for war and a time for peace.<br/>

> [!bible]+ Ecclesiastes 9:11
>  **11** I again saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the mighty, and neither is bread to the wise nor riches to the discerning nor favor to men who know; for time and misfortune overtake them all.

JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
JESUS yes misfortune is definitely a better translation in Ecclesiastes 9.11 there
JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
JESUS because some others translate it as **time and chance**
and of course we know that there's no such thing as chance in GOD's sovereignty
JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
JESUS thank YOU for such amazing BIBLE translations
JESUS please help us also make an amazing BIBLE translation one day FATHER GOD 
in JESUS HOLY NAME we pray LORD GOD 
AMEN

JESUS please forgive me 
JESUS i don't want and didn't want to make him embarrassed or ashamed

> [!bible]+ Ezra 9:8
>  **8** But now for a brief moment grace has been <i>shown </i>from Yahweh our God, to leave us an escaped remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may enlighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our slavery.

why JESUS showed grace? because the people deserved it? of course not
JESUS showed grace for the sake of HIS Name
> [!bible]+ Romans 1:4-6
>  **4** who was designated as the Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord, **5** through whom we received grace and apostleship for <i>the </i>obedience of faith among all the Gentiles for the sake of His name, **6** among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ;

> [!bible]+ Psalm 23:3
>  **3** He restores my soul;<br/>He guides me in the paths of righteousness<br/>For His name‚Äôs sake.<br/>

> [!bible]+ Psalm 106:8
>  **8** Yet He saved them for the sake of His name,<br/>That He might make His might known.<br/>

> [!bible]+ Isaiah 66:5
>  **5** Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at His word:<br/>‚ÄúYour brothers who hate you, who exclude you for My name‚Äôs sake,<br/>Have said, ‚ÄòLet Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your gladness.‚Äô<br/>But they will be put to shame.<br/>

why are we trying to earn YOUR favor JESUS please show us
JESUS please humble us FATHER GOD
JESUS please help us LORD we beg YOU FATHER GOD
in JESUS HOLY NAME
AMEN

> [!bible]+ James 4:1-7
>  **1** <b>Draw Near to God</b><br/>What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? **2** You lust and do not have, <i>so </i>you murder. You are envious and cannot obtain, <i>so </i>you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. **3** You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend <i>it </i>on your pleasures. **4** You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world sets himself as an enemy of God. **5** Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: ‚ÄúHe jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us‚Äù? **6** But He gives a greater grace. Therefore <i>it </i>says, ‚ÄúGod is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble.‚Äù **7** Be subject therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

> [!bible]+ Psalm 30:3-12
>  **3** O Yahweh, You have brought up my soul from Sheol;<br/>You have kept me alive, that I would not go down to the pit.<br/> **4** Sing praise to Yahweh, you His holy ones,<br/>And give thanks for the remembrance of His holy <i>name</i>.<br/> **5** For His anger is but for a moment,<br/>His favor is for a lifetime;<br/>Weeping may last for the night,<br/>But a shout of joy <i>comes </i>in the morning.<br/> **6** Now as for me, I said in my prosperity,<br/>‚ÄúI will never be shaken.‚Äù<br/> **7** O Yahweh, by Your favor You have made my mountain to stand strong;<br/>You hid Your face, I was dismayed.<br/> **8** To You, O Yahweh, I called,<br/>And to the Lord I made supplication:<br/> **9** ‚ÄúWhat profit is there in my blood, if I go down to the pit?<br/>Will the dust praise You? Will it declare Your truth?<br/> **10** ‚ÄúHear, O Yahweh, and be gracious to me;<br/>O Yahweh, be my helper.‚Äù<br/> **11** You have turned for me my mourning into dancing;<br/>You have loosed my sackcloth and girded me with gladness,<br/> **12** That <i>my </i>glory may sing praise to You and not be silent.<br/>O Yahweh my God, I will give thanks to You forever.<br/>

> [!bible]+ 1 Timothy 6:17-21
>  **17** Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty or to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly supplies us with all things to enjoy. **18** <i>Command them </i>to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, **19** storing up for themselves the treasure of a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is life indeed. **20** O Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you, turning aside from godless <i>and </i>empty chatter <i>and </i>the opposing arguments of what is falsely called knowledge‚Äî **21** which some, while professing, have gone astray from the faith. Grace be with you.

> [!bible]+ Colossians 3:23-25
>  **23** Whatever you do, do your work heartily, as for the Lord rather than for men, **24** knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance. Serve the Lord Christ. **25** For he who does wrong will receive the consequences of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality.
