![[Philippians 2#12]]

evangelism is sharing the Gospel
why we have to share the Gospel: because this generation haven‚Äôt heart
types of evangelism: quick (JESUS is calling, handing out or leaving BIBLES \[New Testaments or Gospels, whichever one is the cheapest where you are]), conversational (Way of the Master, Quick Law Evangelism)
why JESUS loves you is not spreading the Gospel
be careful using BIBLE verses: some people might understand eternal life for example as eternal life here on earth
if a person ignores you, just move on
if people laugh at you or mock you or mistreat you in any other way, rejoice! GOD found you worthy to be persecuted for the sake of righteousness
social media evangelism might be very good: reading the BIBLE on stream or recording, posting BIBLE verses or BIBLE links wherever, going through streams and spreading the Gospel there
those are the ones we tried, some we haven‚Äôt yet tried: open air preaching
the Quick Law method is good because it keeps the conversation short and very focused: the enemy will certainly send his agents to try to distract you. just ignoring them would be the best choice i think
dont let your pride get in the way
if a person really gets uncomfortable by the Law, probably respect the person and leave i guess. not sure though
if a person doesnt believe in heaven, hell or the judgement: just say ‚Äúour believes dont change reality, do they?‚Äù probably and just try to move on is our best choice. we cant really convince them of either of those, its gotta be accepted by faith
when they start bombarding you with questions in response to your question, it is not good: ignoring them would probably be not too good, but maybe try warning them and reminding them about the question you asked, very lovingly and gently

cleaning
wet cleaning is good, helps to make it easier
always clean from top to bottom
