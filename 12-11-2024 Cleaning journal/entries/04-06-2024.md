Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. – John 14:6

And there is salvation in no one else; for there is no other name under heaven that has been given among mankind by which we must be saved. - Acts 4:12

The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; All those who follow His commandments have a good understanding; His praise endures forever. – Psalm 111:10
