Привіт. Сьогодні все нормально, гарно поспав, тепер готовий продовжувати роботу. Причина чому я перестав нормально засинати останні дні це того шо я не ставив собі ніякі ютуб відео на вечір і не засинав під них. Бо тоді мій слух просто фокусувався на них допоки не заснув би і все. А так я сидів мучився слухав цього гандона зверху і не міг заснути. Тому та, ця проблема вирішена, тепер я знаю як мій організм звик засинати. Звичайно не ідеальний варіант, але маємо шо маємо.

Тепер, давай швиденько пройдемось по гібхабу і трохи продивимось шо ми хочемо зробити сьогодні. А хоча ні, я мабуть одразу піду працювати над age-caulculator. І, перед цим, перероблю frontend mentor solutions під NextJS і TS, і туди вже закину age calculator. Все, це достатньо гарний план на день. Щасти. 10:15

Alright man ill switch to english cause i think in it anyway and i type in it way faster than i do in ukrainian. i know that its bad and shit but fuck it, just whatever. i wanna get a job in tech. everybody in tech speaks english. so lets fucking go. and i can write so much more since i type faster. and i also have less trouble expressing my ideas since im more comfortable with this language. win win, in short.

so, lets start analysing stuff and going from there. oh man i already feel like the thoughts are more clear this way. not sure how viable this is for a long term perspective of my journaling, but whatever. just fucking forget about it. you write the stuff and thats the only thing that matters. so lets go.

i wanna learn react. and im learning react. if i wanna learn fast, i gotta read a lot. by reading i will have more ideas on my projects and generally more knowledge to implement those projects.

today i was thinking about moving from Ukraine. and i think i wanna eventually move away from here. i dont like living here. all this patriotism vanishes when you try to think of your long term goals and the job opportunities here. so yeah i wanna eventually move to the Netherlands. but first, i think i need at least some experience in the industry and some solid knowledge and a foundation for learning further and making more money as a frontend web developer.

okay, so i was just watching a video by Kyle on Web Dev Simplified. by the way i switched youtube account to seesmof and on seesmof i have only the coding stuff that in my subscriptions. so that will definitely help me learn and grow. cause before that point youtube was the ultimate place for my procrasitnation. i was spending a ton of time there and was getting zero value out. so yeah i decided to switch. now back to the point. i remembered one crucial point when developing apps and any software at this point, which i seemed to have completely forgotten of.

just plugged in the last sentence into chatGPT and it gave me some useful insights. cause on itself it seemed unnecessarily verbose and complicated. so the correct way would probably be - i remembered one crucial point for developing any software, which i seemed to have completely forgotten about. yeah, thats right. sooo, that point is that you cannot think of a solution and trying to develop it at the same time. you either develop it, meaning you implement the idea or youre thinking about the solution. you gotta separate these points. back in the day when i was coding stuff for uni i somehow came up of this on my own, but now i gotta reinforce it by implementing it and using in all of my projects. you have to separate the logic and the implementation, you know? you gotta first know exactly how you will solve it and only then try to actually solve it with code, alright. the way i was doing it in school was i was writing comments. simple comments for an algorithm i will be implementing. and thats it, it used to help tremendously, i remember. this way i was both decomposing the problem, and also writing and coming up with the algorithm itself.

Alright its really late now so i gotta be quick. plus i only got 6 minutes left before going to bed. im trying out the new pomodoro which is 52/17. well see how it goes. so yeah i got a little stuck on yotube, but it is a process, bro, you still got that addiciton so you will ineviteably be stucking in those mindless scrolling and listening, but just remember that you'll get there. the hardest part is already behind. so you got this, king, you go. tomorrow will be the best day of your life that will change you forever in the ways that you would've never thought of. you are going to the market with mom which will already make your day, but also, after that, after you come back home all kinda tired and stuff, you will sit down, be patient with yourself and learn as much frontend as you can. and this will fucking make you the happiest person in the world. you see, you already feel happy just thinking about this. man, you gotta be excited, cause this will be tremendously exsiting, so you better be exsited for it. bro, you got this. you're the best, man. youre learning like a fucking walking textbook bro. youre just suck up and absorb all that info like a freaking sponge. so you got this bro. it doesnt matter where you live, bro, as long as you're happy. and what will make you happy is small moments like this when you realise that life is good, you just overcomplicate it. and after that, you can be free to do anything you want and pursue your goals. so realise that with every inch and every cell in your body and live with that idea. you are free to do anything. life is great. you will succeed. your peers dont put nearly as much effort into learning as you do. their summer looks completely different from yours. and it will pay off, bro, just trust me. simply believe me and go with it. i know you better then anyone else out there. please just believe me, this shit will pay off. your burnouts and your stress, it all will pay off. the law of cause and consequence is working, it is prominent as hell throughout our life. everything you do is either a cause or a consequence. and its up to you to decide which one is which and what to do with that. so bro, just keep fucking going. you are going with an incredible pace. keep that shit up. of course dont work your ass off without breaks. this new pomodoro split of 52/17 will help you stay fresh and dont burn yourself out, you know? so, alright now, go get some rest and get really excited for tomorrow, cause tomorrow is the greatest day in your life, remember that. alright, king, go get some nice sleep and cya tomorrow. peace out. 23:28
