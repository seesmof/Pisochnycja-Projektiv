Daddy Jesus we beg YOU to help us understand our emotions so that we can be absolutely calm and loving and caring and pleasing to YOU FATHER GOD in any and every circumstance Daddy JESUS 
please teach us what emotions are and how to control them?

always be conscious of your thoughts and feelings, control them and never follow on the emotions 
since they are from the flesh, they don't lead to anything good
have love, Daddy JESUS please give us love
please Daddy JESUS teach us how to love 

the emotions might not be the problem 
maybe it's the lack of patience
slowing down will help develop patience
HOLY SPIRIT please help us slow down permanently Daddy JESUS in JESUS Holy Name we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING JESUS CHRIST our HOLY KING Most High ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôèüèº Amen
