Simply a society of broken traumatized people, who were traumatized by their parents or the circumstances of their past, and are now traumatizing us. Today i feel hopeless and sad, down and in despair. my parents disappointed me yesterday. i told you the story already, but my uncle, whom i called in the middle of the winter. oh, nevermind. there is always hope though in Christ Jesus. i just have to persevere. LORD, please give me strength and patience to do so. please forgive me all my sins, Father, please forgive me, Lord, i am such a horrible sinner. i almost relapsed today again. i first started looking for some images on telegram, you know what kind of images of course, and i even found an actual porn video. and my dick got aroused and all, but i didnt feel a sense of satisfaction, i never touched it though. and so i went and downloaded tor on my phone to look at even more provocative and horrible images of girls, Again. but thanks God Lord didnt let me see what i wanted to see. no sites were available and the one that did work showed only the dressed girls. by that point my penis got into the normal state and so that was the obvious sign to me from God that "son, it is not worth it", and i so agree. yeah, man, i dont know what i would've been doing without God, i would've been in such a deep depression probably by this point if not for God our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and His infinite mercy and grace. i am so thankful to you, Lord. please forgive me and give me strength to persevere through these trials you are putting me through. in the mighty name of Jesus, amen üôè

i think a different perspective on lust might be useful. as i think i told you earlier today, when i've seen porn again, it wasnt anything special at all. quite the opposite, i was not amazed by it whatsoever. and so i think the chemical reactions in my brain when i was nutting while watching those awful materials are just left over, but logically and rationally i realise that this is just not what i want. even if i do jerk off while watching at some girl or whatever, would it change anything? of course not. it will numb the pain for a few moments, maybe. but it will not remove my problems, no way. my problems and my life would still be there after i finish. and so there's really no point in doing that if you ask me. better rely on Jesus, His support is everlasting and never-ending. amen üôè

oh, and of course not only the chemical reactions and merely scientific stuff, but also the enemy attacks. cause im not having those thoughts, i do not want any of that to happen, truly and genuinely. and those thoughts and desires are obviously planted there by the enemy. so may God always keep me close to Him and help me defeat those attacks. in the mighty name of Jesus, amen üôè

i lately feel like reality contradicts God and His teachings. or, a more likely case is that i dont understand reality AT ALL. i continued reading the –°—è—é—á–∏–π —à–ª—è—Ö by –î–ö and i do not understand a thing. if people truly talk like that and if the events described there are real, i just simply resign. i resign all my prior understanding of this world and just give up on it. because it is either that this world has gone completely mad without me even noticing it, or, which is way more likely, i have lost my mind fully. the latter is truly quite a bit more likely to be true. in any case, i am still seeking God first and all i want, no matter what happens at any time, i wanna reunite with my Creator one day and to spend eternity with Him, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, forever together. i do not see anything more beautiful than that. and i highly doubt i will ever see such thing.

do people truly understand stuff? do they really know what they're talking about. sometimes i feel like they're just saying something, but i dont understand why they're even saying that. just now i heard the beginning of the air alarm, or at least i assume thats what the sound is, and i pray to you Lord that if its your will, Father, if you wanna, please save and protect us. i do not understand a single thing, but at least i know you, Lord, which is all i need really.

im trying my best, at least i hope so, but sometimes im just completely lost. i do not understand whats going on or what i am doing, truly. is fate from God? must be. because He created us, so He must've put the meaning behind our lives as well. yeah, definitely. for some reason earlier i thought of fate as being something different, something external. well, thats no wonder, since earlier i understood all kinds of things wrong, even including God. i did not believe in you, Jesus, but now i really hope i've been saved. all i need to do now is to live this life the best i can, enjoy it the best i can and then to meet you, Lord. this is beautiful, yet a bit terrifying. terrifying due to the lack of understanding and maybe even a lack of trust. do i really lack trust in you, Lord? i might be. why? because i think i can know something and understand something, yet i dont understand that i cant. truly this must be the reason. Lord, forgive me, as i am just a sick man trying to figure things out. please help me, if you wanna. that would make things a lot easier.

im honestly really excited to start reading the New Testament. i hope i can find some valuable insight or lessons for myself there. Lord, i hope you can give me some and teach me whatever i need to learn from there.

this life is so confusing, yet so wonderful at times. looking at the weather, the animals, and the world our God created here can sometimes just fascinate me a lot. but looking at people immediately makes me realise how truly sick this world is. i do not know why i feel this way, most likely because im sick in the head myself, but people sometimes just completely throw me off by what they say or what they do. i want to delve into the uncle situation a bit more here but i think ive given it enough attention. way more than it deserved. so lets move on. Lord, if you wanna, please help me move on, Father.

i think ill just continue reading my Bible. not much else to do. american truck simulator is good, but i cant play it for too long, gets boring. and other games are either too addictive, or get boring real quick as well. thank you Jesus, i love you so much, Lord. glory to you forever, Father, my King of Kings and my Lord of Lords. please take care of me, your sick insane servant. amen üôè

i noticed that mondays almost never go well for me. i just joined Jacob's stream and he asked me how im doing, i said "im okay, how are you". right from the point when he asked me how im doing i already felt something weird. and later on in the conversation he was asking and saying stuff as if he knows whats going on. he must understand people way better than i do. he's been really supportive and said i can DM him whenever and that he'll pray for me, which is amazing, thank you Jesus. my right ear just rang for some reason. 

is there something fundemental i dont understand about people? is there some simple thing i just cannot get about them and talking to them? ive always been horrible at talking to people. in childhood, due to the people i hang out with, i was extremely rude and aggressive to all people, mostly due to my fear of whatever, not being accepted or being judged. and these days im mostly honestly just confused by them. i do not understand them. do i have some brain disease thats hindering my understanding? am i mentally handicapped? i do not get it. when Jacob asked whats going on, i said "its okay, sometimes people just completely throw me off by what they do or say", and he asked "was it me? what did i do?". again, it never had anything to do with him, why would he ask that? those are the questions i just cannot get the answers to i guess. unless God gives them to me, but if God wanted to give them, i would've already received them, so God probably wants me to figure this stuff out on my own or something. no idea.

anyways, Lord, im so thankful you give such wonderful compassionate people to me. i do not deserve it, but im so grateful to have them and You, Lord, in my life. thank you Jesus. and i hope i can one day understand them. amen üôè
