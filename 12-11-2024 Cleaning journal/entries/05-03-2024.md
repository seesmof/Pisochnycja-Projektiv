Son
I love you so much that I died for you on that Cross
I will never leave you nor forsake you
You are doing all you can to get to Heaven and i appreciate that
Surely surely you will get there
Your Lord and Savior Jesus Christ

was that you Lord God or was that me just losing my mind?
i have no idea, i think i just completely lost my mind. but my heart still belongs to Jesus my God
please dont leave me Lord Jesus
