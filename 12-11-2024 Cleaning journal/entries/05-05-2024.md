> After they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying, “Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.”
— Acts 14:21-22

through many tribulations we must enter the Kingdom of GOD, thats an Amen and Amen ✝️💗🙏 persevere guys, whatever comes at you, pray to GOD for strength and He will pull you through, because GOD is faithful and GOD is good, He will never leave His sheep ✝️💗🙏 praise Jesus Christ our Almighty Holy GOD Most High 

> My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”
— John 10:27-30

> “I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep. He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees, and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep. I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will hear My voice; and they will become one flock with one shepherd. For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down My life so that I may take it again. No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on My own initiative. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father.”
— John 10:11-18

Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Lord Almighty Holy GOD Most High ✝️💗🙏 praise be to the Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth our Holy Lord Almighty GOD

GOD been showing me some useful resources, i have been enjoying following the M'Cheyne Bible reading plan that goes in 4 threads and reads through the OT once and the NT twice for a year, here's the resources i use to keep track of the progress: [Bible Reading Plan Generator](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/?start=2024-04-25&total=366&format=calendar&order=mcheyne&daysofweek=1,2,3,4,5,6,7&books=OT,NT&lang=en&logic=chapters&checkbox=1&colors=1&dailypsalm=0&dailyproverb=0&otntoverlap=1&reverse=0&stats=1&dailystats=1&nodates=0&includeurls=1&urlsite=biblegateway&urlversion=NASB)

but also GOD helped me find a very interesting resource called The Book of Common Prayer, its, as far as i understand, a collection of prayers and Scripture passages for each day and there are a few very useful plans based on it:

the first one is on BibleGateway, its called in the same way: [Book of Common Prayer](https://www.biblegateway.com/reading-plans/bcp-daily-office/next)

and the other one is on ESV.org, lots of great plans there, its called [Daily Office Lectionary](https://www.esv.org/plans/bcp/)

both of those last for 861 days i think, which is awesome guys praise Jesus Christ our Lord GOD Almighty King Most High ✝️💗🙏

let me know what you guys know about the Book of Common Prayer and if you have any interesting insight on it, i havent read the Book itself, but those plans i like a lot ✝️💗🙏

Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am being tempted by God”; for God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone. But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren. Every good thing given and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow. In the exercise of His will He brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we would be a kind of first fruits among His creatures.
— James 1:12-18

But seek His kingdom, and these things will be added to you. Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the kingdom.
— Luke 12:31-32
