>  **12** But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell? **13** No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living. **14** The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’ **15** It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver. **16** It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire. **17** Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it. **18** Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies. **19** Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. **20** From where then does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell? **21** It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air. **22** Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’ **23** But God understands its way, and He knows its place. **24** For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. **25** When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters, **26** when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt, **27** then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out. **28** And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”
