GOD bless guys, praise Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Most High ✝️💗🙏

so GOD showed me a very simple method to share the Gospel with anybody:

you can start off with some little introduction, one interesting one i heard is sharing an ultimate statistic that 10 out of 10 people die, and going from there, but im not good at expressing myself and kinda using that as a starting point, so here's the method GOD helped me find:

1. all people are sinners: **for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God** (Rom 3:23)
2. and all people deserve to go to hell: **For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.** (Rom 6:23)
3. but GOD loves us very much: **But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.** (Rom 5:8)
   - here you can also add: **For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life.** (John 3:16)
4. and the only way to get saved is through faith in Jesus Christ our Lord: **that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved;** (Rom 10:9) **for “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”** (Rom 10:13)
   - and here you can also add: **Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.** (John 14:6)
