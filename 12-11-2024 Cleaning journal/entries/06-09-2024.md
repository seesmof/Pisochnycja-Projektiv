>  **5** And the LORD descended in a cloud, stood with him there, and proclaimed His name, the LORD. **6** Then the LORD passed in front of Moses and called out: “The LORD, the LORD God, is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness, **7** maintaining loving devotion to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sin. Yet He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished; He will visit the iniquity of the fathers on their children and grandchildren to the third and fourth generations.”

He wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments. **29** And when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was unaware that his face had become radiant from speaking with the LORD. **30** Aaron and all the Israelites looked at Moses, and behold, his face was radiant. And they were afraid to approach him.

JESUS i love YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH

Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness, so that they will have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” And God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the sky and over every living thing that creeps on the earth.”
— Genesis 1:26-28

Then Yahweh God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.” And out of the ground Yahweh God had formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and He brought each to the man to see what he would call it; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. And the man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper suitable for him. So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; then He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. And Yahweh God fashioned the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman, and He brought her to the man. Then the man said,
“This one finally is bone of my bones,
And flesh of my flesh;
This one shall be called Woman,
Because this one was taken out of Man.”
Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.
— Genesis 2:18-24

**І сказав Бог: Створімо людину за Нашим образом і подобою, — і хай панують над рибами морськими, птахами небесними, худобою, над усією землею й усіма плазунами, які повзають по землі. І створив Бог людину — за Божим образом створив її; Він створив їх чоловіком і жінкою. Бог поблагословив їх, кажучи: Зростайте і розмножуйтеся, наповніть землю і володійте нею, пануйте над рибами морськими і птахами небесними, усією худобою, усією землею й усіма плазунами, які повзають по землі.**
Буття 1:26-28 UTT

**І сказав Господь Бог: Недобре бути чоловікові самотнім. Створімо для нього помічника — такого, як він. І створив Бог ще із землі всіх польових звірів, і всіх небесних птахів; Він привів їх до Адама, щоби побачити, як їх назве. І як назвав Адам кожну живу душу, — так вона і звалася. І дав Адам назви всім тваринам, всім небесним птахам і всім польовим звірам, та Адамові не знайшлося помічника, подібного до нього. Тож Бог наслав глибокий сон на Адама, і той заснув. І Бог взяв одне з його ребер, а його місце заповнив тілом. Ребро, яке взяв у Адама, Господь Бог перетворив на жінку і привів її до Адама. І сказав Адам: Це тепер кістка з моїх кісток і тіло з мого тіла! Вона буде називатися жінкою, адже зі свого чоловіка була взята. Тому залишить чоловік свого батька й матір і пристане до своєї жінки, — і будуть обоє одним тілом.**
