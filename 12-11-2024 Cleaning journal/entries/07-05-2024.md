Amen okay awesome so is there a way to convert a word document to osis? cause i wanna have a Bible translation and i wanna be able to easily mark it up by just selecting the range of text by mouse and applying some style to it like Red Letter or italic or so on, and Word works really well for that. but at the end of the day i definitely want it to be queryable so we need a more recognizable file format for that which is where osis comes in.

Based on the provided sources, it seems that converting a Word document to OSIS (Open Scripture Information Standard) format is possible. The process involves using tools like the Paratext SFM files, which can be converted to OSIS XML. Once the conversion is done, various outputs can be generated, including OSIS XML files, eBooks, SWORD Bible modules, dictionary modules, and Java-ME JAR apps for feature phones[1].

To convert a Word document to OSIS format, you would first need to convert the Word document to ODT (Open Document Text) format, which can be done using tools like Zamzar[3]. Once the document is in ODT format, you can then proceed with the conversion to OSIS XML using the appropriate tools and processes mentioned in the GitHub project related to OSIS converters[1].

By converting your Bible translation from Word to OSIS format, you can maintain the ability to mark up the text with styles like Red Letter or italics in Word, while also ensuring that the final document is queryable and in a recognizable format for Bible-related applications and tools that support OSIS XML[1][3].

**For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in cleverness of speech, so that the cross of Christ would not be made void.** (1 Corinthians 1:17)

i think what GOD means here through our brother Saint Paul is that our job is to not flatter people with fancy words that they might not understand, but rather explain them very simply and directly what Christ Jesus our Lord did for all people: we all sinned and we deserve eternal death, but GOD because of His love for us sent His Only Son Jesus Christ on earth in human form around 2000 years ago to live a perfect life that nobody ever could live except Him, and to suffer and die on the cross for us, taking away our sins upon Him and thus paying all the penalty for all sin, all the fines, so to say, that we owe GOD for our sins, Jesus took it all away. and this is what GOD calls us to do: preach the Gospel, but not with the words of eloquent wisdom (meaning not overcomplicating things that dont require it), but simply and clearly - the Good News of Immense Unsearchable and Indescribable Love of GOD, the Love that GOD has for each and every one of us completely unconditionaly and independant of our past actions and sins. GOD is a GOD of mercy, He wants to forgive us all and wants to wash away our sins and doesnt want any single soul of ours to perish ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè GOD bless brother Marvin, hope this helps, thats how i understand it and from what GOD taught me

Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.
‚Äî Matthew 18:22

A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.‚Äù
‚Äî John 13:34-35

But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
‚Äî 1 Timothy 5:8

There are six things which the LORD hates,
Yes, seven which are an abomination to Him:
Haughty eyes, a lying tongue,
And hands that shed innocent blood,
A heart that devises wicked plans,
Feet that run rapidly to evil,
A false witness who utters lies,
And one who spreads strife among brothers.
‚Äî Proverbs 6:16-19

Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be made complete in the same mind and in the same judgment.
‚Äî 1 Corinthians 1:10

Pursue peace with all men, and the sanctification without which no one will see the Lord.
‚Äî Hebrews 12:14

seven's thing that is an abomination to Jesus Christ the Lord Almighty GOD: the one who spreads strife (dispute, division) among brothers. the Lord GOD is very very clear on what we should do in such situations: to forgive and to love

Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
‚Äî 1 Corinthians 13:4-7

love bears and endures ALL things, guys ‚úùÔ∏è the place youre at is exactly where satan wants you to be, please repent - make a turn around and do what GOD calls you to do: forgive and help your family, no matter what they do or did

For if you forgive others for their transgressions, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others, then your Father will not forgive your transgressions.
‚Äî Matthew 6:14-15

Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also has forgiven you.
‚Äî Ephesians 4:31-32

Jesus Christ our Holy Lord Almighty Living GOD has forgiven us so much more, so please guys and pray and encourage you guys - forgive, for you want the Lord GOD to forgive you also ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè GOD bless you and i hope Jesus Christ our Lord GOD shows you and teaches you all the steps you need to take from this point onwards, seek Jesus and His will and you will not be disappointed
