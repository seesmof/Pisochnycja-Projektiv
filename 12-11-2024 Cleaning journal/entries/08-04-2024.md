Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith; Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching; Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
-- [**Romans 12:6-8**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2012%3A6-8&version=KJV>)

Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
-- [**Romans 12:14-15**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2012%3A14-15&version=KJV>)

Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
-- [**2 Timothy 3:12**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim%203%3A12&version=KJV>)

But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
-- [**Matthew 24:13**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mat%2024%3A13&version=KJV>)

However, since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, each of us is to use them properly: if prophecy, in proportion to one’s faith; if service, in the act of serving; or the one who teaches, in the act of teaching; or the one who exhorts, in the work of exhortation; the one who gives, with generosity; the one who is in leadership, with diligence; the one who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.
-- [**Romans 12:6-8**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2012%3A6-8&version=NASB>)

Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.
-- [**Romans 12:14-15**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%2012%3A14-15&version=NASB>)

Indeed, all who want to live in a godly way in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
-- [**2 Timothy 3:12**](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Tim%203%3A12&version=NASB>)

But the one who endures to the end is the one who will be saved.
