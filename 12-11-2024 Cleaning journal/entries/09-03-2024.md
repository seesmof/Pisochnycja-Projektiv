okay its time to talk
i am so exhausted and i dont know what to do anymore
God please help me
Lord Jesus i just wanna be with you forever Lord GOD
but i also gotta remember that im still in this world, why?
because GOD has a plan for me
He wants to use me in some way
why? i dont know, i just gotta trust Him

i asked Lord Jesus what can i do right now? He said slow down
