JESUS helped us calculate how much money we need 
each day we need a bottle of water, it's about 22 money and a piece of bread is probably more than enough for us, it's around 20
so let's say we need 50 money each day
there are 31 days in a month, so we would need 50 times 31 which is 1550 money each month
since we have 4 people in family, we would need 4 times that, or even 6 if we wanna provide for the grandparents
so that would be 1550 times 4 let's say which is 6200 JESUS thank YOU LORD 
and if we want 1550 times 6 that would be 9300 JESUS thank YOU HALLELUJAH 
right now we can provide only for ourselves which is not good
our monthly income is around 2800 praise JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY 
and a tithe from that is 280, so we have 2520 money per month, which is only for our food
JESUS YOU ARE so good FATHER GOD 
HALLELUJAH JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
AMEN

bread costs around 22 and we can surely buy regular canned water, which is almost 3 money per liter 
we might need up to 2 liters per day so that would be 6 money for water
and so 28 and let's make it 30 money per day for food JESUS thank YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH 
and 30 times 91 is 930

JESUS please take me home im so tired FATHER GOD
JESUS please i beg YOU LORD
in JESUS HOLY NAME
AMEN

**that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through Him. Whoever believes in Him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son. And this is the verdict: The Light has come into the world, but men loved the darkness rather than the Light because their deeds were evil. Everyone who does evil hates the Light, and does not come into the Light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. But whoever practices the truth comes into the Light, so that it may be seen clearly that what he has done has been accomplished in God.”**
John 3:15-21 BSB https://bolls.life/BSB/43/3/15-21/

**Хто вірує в Сина, той має вічне життя; а хто в Сина не вірує, той життя не побачить а гнів Божий на нім перебуває.**

> [!bible]+ [Galatians 2:19-21 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/48/2/)
>  **19** For through the law I died to the law so that I might live to God. **20** I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me. **21** I do not set aside the grace of God. For if righteousness comes through the law, Christ died for nothing.

> [!bible]+ [John 15:12-14 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/43/15/)
>  **12** This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you. **13** Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. **14** You are My friends if you do what I command you.

> [!bible]+ [1 Corinthians 13:11-13 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/46/13/)
>  **11** When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways. **12** Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known. **13** And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.

as if that Psalm 42 was written exactly for me
> [!bible]+ [Psalm 42:2 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/19/42/)
>  **2** My soul thirsts for God, the living God. When shall I come and appear in God’s presence?

**І схоплена була звірина, а з нею неправдивий пророк, що ознаки чинив перед нею, що ними звів тих, хто знамено звірини прийняв і поклонився був образові її. Обоє вони були вкинені живими до огняного озера, що сіркою горіло... А решта побита була мечем Того, Хто сидів на коні, що виходив із уст Його. І все птаство наїлося їхніми трупами...**
Об’явлення 19:20-21
