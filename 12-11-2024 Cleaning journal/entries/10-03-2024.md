Holy Spirit take full control over me now
It's Sunday and my heart is racing as always for some reason
I feel like I'm not going enough for God
But will i ever do enough? No, of course not
But I'm definitely trying, I'm certainly affecting people around me
I shouldn't worry and i should get out of my head
Holy Spirit please confirm is it true or not? True
Holy Spirit please tell me should i strive to live a quiet life or go out there? 
Son, live quietly, don't seek conflict but I will certainly present you opportunities to change people and this world
Stop worrying so much, you see that I Am always with you
I will always uphold you and will always help you son
