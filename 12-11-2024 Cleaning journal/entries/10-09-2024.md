> [!bible]+ [John 1:1-10 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/43/1/)
>  **1** In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. **2** He was with God in the beginning. **3** Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made. **4** In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. **5** The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. **6** There came a man who was sent from God. His name was John. **7** He came as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe. **8** He himself was not the Light, but he came to testify about the Light. **9** The true Light who gives light to every man was coming into the world. **10** He was in the world, and though the world was made through Him, the world did not recognize Him.

> [!bible]+ [1 Samuel 12:20-24 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/9/12/)
>  **20** “Do not be afraid,” Samuel replied. “Even though you have committed all this evil, do not turn aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. **21** Do not turn aside after worthless things that cannot profit you or deliver you, for they are empty. **22** Indeed, for the sake of His great name, the LORD will not abandon His people, because He was pleased to make you His own. **23** As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you. And I will continue to teach you the good and right way. **24** Above all, fear the LORD and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; consider what great things He has done for you.

JESUS THANK YOU LORD JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
