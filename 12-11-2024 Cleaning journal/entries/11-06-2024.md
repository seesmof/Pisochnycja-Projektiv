**But we urge you, brothers _and sisters_, to excel _even_ more, and to make it your ambition to lead a quiet life and attend to your own _business_ and work with your hands, just as we instructed you, so that you will behave properly toward outsiders and not be in any need.**
– 1 Thessalonians 4:10b-12

Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️💖🤲 GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed day

**And some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers as well were conversing with him. Some were saying, “What could this scavenger of tidbits want to say?” Others, “He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities,”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some _began_ to scoff, but others said, “We shall hear from you again concerning this.”**
– Acts 17:18,32

**When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. What he says to you, do.”**
— Genesis 41:55

— John 2:5

**can i translate ESV into Ukrainian?**

Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️❣️🙏 GOD bless you guys, i pray and hope youre doing very well. the stuff youre doing with your Crossway Publishing and online ministries and the printed Bibles you produce are just superb, i pray our Lord Jesus Christ our Holy GOD Most High continues guiding you in the faithful right direction of His Truth and provides for you always ✝️💌🤲

so, GOD willing, i wanna make a Bible translation from English into Ukrainian and publish it into Public Domain, since i dont know the original Hebrew nor Greek, but GOD blessed me with a good understanding of English so i think that would be a huge blessing to our Ukrainian brothers and sisters here if it comes out ✝️💟🕊️ 

and so ive been looking at some different options to use as my base or source text, at first i just thought to make a completely translation of the New American Standard Bible (NASB), but its all copyrighted and i dont want neither me nor my relatives to have any problems, so GOD helped me find the Berean Standard Bible, which is thankfully in Public Domain and has really nice formatting so i thought of using that

but then as i was just reading my Bible in the NASB version as i usually do, i found some wording there a bit unclear so i decided to see what the ESV says and i liked it better and now plan to use it as my main Bible ✝️🤲 the only thing i dont like about the ESV guys is that you have the GOD's Pronouns not capitalized, but thats not an issue at all, just a nice distinction i think. and both the BSB and NASB have the GOD's Pronouns capitalized, and i also plan to do as well in my potential Bible translation

but i just wanted to ask you guys, is it possible for me to use the ESV as a base Bible translation for my own potential Bible translation? i love the BSB formatting so maybe ill stick to that, but i just love the wording you use in the ESV so i really wanna use that. is it possible for me to use the ESV Bible translation, make a translation of it into Ukrainian and publish it into Public Domain without any issues? please let me know guys, cause im clueless about all this copyrighting stuff ✝️❣️📿

GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed day ✝️💓🕊️
