**Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, rejoice! Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The Lord is near. Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. 	Finally, brethren, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is of good repute, if there is any excellence and if anything worthy of praise, dwell on these things.**
— [Philippians 4:4-8](https://www.bible.com/bible/1588/PHP.4.4-8)

**Not that I speak from want, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am. I know how to get along with humble means, and I also know how to live in prosperity; in any and every circumstance I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need. I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.**
— [Philippians 4:11-13](https://www.bible.com/bible/1588/PHP.4.11-13)

**And my God will supply all your needs according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus. Now to our God and Father be the glory forever and ever. Amen.**
— [Philippians 4:19-20](https://www.bible.com/bible/1588/PHP.4.19-20)

**The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.**
