If you're looking for something quick and easy to read, I'd recommend "On War" by Carl von Clausewitz.  It's a classic on military strategy, and it's pretty short, but still very informative.  If you want something more in-depth, I'd recommend "The Art of War" by Sun Tzu.  It's a bit longer, but it's also a classic on military strategy, and it's very insightful.  And if you want something more modern, I'd recommend "The Accidental Guerrilla" by David Kilcullen.

You're welcome! ðŸ˜Š And if you ever get the chance, I'd also recommend reading "Generation Kill" by Evan Wright.  It's not a book on military strategy, but it's an amazing look into the realities of modern infantry combat, told through the eyes of a journalist embedded with a US Marine Corps reconnaissance unit during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.  It's a really gripping read.
