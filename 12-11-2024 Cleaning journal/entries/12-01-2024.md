Lord calls me to go thank my grandfather and potentially my grandmother today on the dinnertable. To thank my grandpa for that he helped me to find God, and my grandma for that she was very attentive in nurturing me when i was young. May God give me all the strength and courage i need to complete this assignment, my Lord, your servant calls and asks for it, God, please shall Your will be done, Jesus. In Jesus name, Amen üôè
