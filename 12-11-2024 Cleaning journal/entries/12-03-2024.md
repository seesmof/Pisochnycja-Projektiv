blood represents the soul, thats why GOD strictly prohibits eating any blood whatsoever
and by the way since this was in the context of the Mosaic Law for Jews, and it was talking about the animals, it means that the animals have souls too - which their blood represents
and since all souls are eternal, it means we will see our deceased animals in heaven, very hopefully üôèüíó‚úùÔ∏è
