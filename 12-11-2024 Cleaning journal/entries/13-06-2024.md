*bug report and Ukrainian translation proposal*

Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ‚úùÔ∏èüíû GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed day

so im trying out your game called Rise of Industry and looks good so far but i think i found a bug in tutorial mode, or im not getting something. so after placing a water facility with water collectors the next step is to connect them with roads and so i started laying out a gravel rural road and i clicked once the square right next to the main water facility entrance and i think it bugged out and it constantly points with an arrow there and doesnt allow me to do anything. if i click that square again, nothing happens, and i dont think i can draw any other roads either. the screenshots are attached to the letter ‚úùÔ∏è‚ù£Ô∏è

also guys would you be interested in getting the game translated into Ukrainian? completely at no cost all, for free, just drop me the files and, GOD willing, whenever i have some time, i will translate them and send them back to you ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüìø

GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed day today and forevermore ‚úùÔ∏èüíìüïäÔ∏è

Walking in the Light

**This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that¬†God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.¬†If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and¬†do not practice the truth.¬†But¬†if we walk in the light,¬†as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and¬†the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.¬†If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and¬†the truth is not in us.¬†If we confess our sins, he is¬†faithful and just to forgive us our sins and¬†to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.¬†If we say we have not sinned,¬†we make him a liar, and¬†his word is not in us.**

Contributions for the Tabernacle

**Moses said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, ‚ÄúThis is the thing that the LORD has commanded. Take from among you a contribution to the LORD. Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the LORD‚Äôs contribution: gold, silver, and bronze; blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; goats‚Äô hair, tanned rams‚Äô skins, and goatskins; acacia wood, oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, and onyx stones and stones for setting, for the ephod and for the breastpiece.**

**‚ÄúLet every skillful craftsman among you come and make all that the LORD has commanded: the tabernacle, its tent and its covering, its hooks and its frames, its bars, its pillars, and its bases; the ark with its poles, the mercy seat, and the veil of the screen; the table with its poles and all its utensils, and the bread of the Presence; the lampstand also for the light, with its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light; and the altar of incense, with its poles, and the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the screen for the door, at the door of the tabernacle; the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of bronze, its poles, and all its utensils, the basin and its stand; the hangings of the court, its pillars and its bases, and the screen for the gate of the court; the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court, and their cords; the finely worked garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, for their service as priests.‚Äù**
‚Äé
**Then all the congregation of the people of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. And they came, everyone whose heart stirred him, and everyone whose spirit moved him, and brought the LORD‚Äôs contribution to be used for the tent of meeting, and for all its service, and for the holy garments. So they came, both men and women. All who were of a willing heart brought brooches and earrings and signet rings and armlets, all sorts of gold objects, every man dedicating an offering of gold to the LORD. And every one who possessed blue or purple or scarlet yarns or fine linen or goats‚Äô hair or tanned rams‚Äô skins or goatskins brought them. Everyone who could make a contribution of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD‚Äôs contribution. And every one who possessed acacia wood of any use in the work brought it. And every skillful woman spun with her hands, and they all brought what they had spun in blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen. All the women whose hearts stirred them to use their skill spun the goats‚Äô hair. And the leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set, for the ephod and for the breastpiece, and spices and oil for the light, and for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense. All the men and women, the people of Israel, whose heart moved them to bring anything for the work that the LORD had commanded by Moses to be done brought it as a freewill offering to the LORD.**
