##### tips for studying for brother Marvin
Hallelujah thank YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS ‚úùÔ∏è üíó üôè okay brother Marvin so here's some tips for studying that GOD helped me remember:
###### rely Only on JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY
GOD showed me this very clearly on the last exam. the moment i tried relying on anything else that is not JESUS, like opening up some notes and study materials to try and get answers from there while on exam, i failed miserably. but once i gave it all into GOD'S Holy Hands, it was very easy. not saying that you shouldn't prepare though, quite the opposite: do your best to prepare, but don't try cheating or putting your trust in anything but JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH ‚úùÔ∏è üôè üíï which perfectly leads us into the next point:
###### walk with integrity, never cheat 
never cheat brother Marvin, it's an abomination to JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH ‚úùÔ∏èüíïüôè if you trust JESUS our LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding but in all your ways acknowledge HIM, GOD will make your paths straight 
###### be diligent 
GOD wants us to excel, and wherever KING JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY puts us, this is our ministry. and this one is definitely not easy. there are days when i wanna just get by and do the bare minimum but JESUS our LORD wants us to be worthy representatives of GOD so we should try and do our best to diligently do our work as for the LORD JESUS and not for men ‚úùÔ∏èüíñüôè
###### prioritize exam disciplines 
not sure how it works in Germany brother Marvin, but in here they give us our curriculum for semester and on some disciplines we'll have an exam and on others all it takes is just do all the homework. so it's important to find a good balance here, to spend more time studying for the exams but also not to neglect other disciplines ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè GOD is still teaching me this one
###### try to complete all homework as soon as possible 
this is more of an optional one, but just from experience: it is always best to get all those homework individual tasks done as soon as you can. this will not only free up time for you to serve JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY more but also gives a possibility to finish the entire semester earlier, which also just frees more time for JESUS our LORD ‚úùÔ∏èüíïüôè so yeah try finishing all the tasks quickly and don't postpone them too much because if you, you might end up having to speedrun the whole semester in a few weeks üòÑ 
###### seek JESUS first
there's most likely gonna be a lot of work you'll need to do throughout your studying years, which will take up a lot of your time. so please don't neglect your relationship with JESUS our LORD and your spiritual needs. make time for reading the Bible, make time for prayer and always seek first the Kingdom of GOD and JESUS' Righteousness and all the other things GOD will add to you ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè
###### conclusions and final notes 
yeah man studying can be fun but most of the time it's not fun at all. so just rely on JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH, if GOD called you to it, then surely HE will get you through it all ‚úùÔ∏èüíïüôè just find time for GOD always, be diligent, walk with integrity and pray without ceasing. Hallelujah thank YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY, GOD bless you brother Marvin, i pray and hope that helps

##### Ecclesiastes impressions sharing 
**A good name is better than a good ointment,
And the day of one‚Äôs death is better than the day of one‚Äôs birth.**
‚Äî Ecclesiastes 7:1

very strange and impressions from reading the Book of Ecclesiastes now. there's definitely much wisdom to be found there, especially on how to treat this world and our lives in it, but it seems just so depressing to me, do you guys feel that way also? ‚úùÔ∏èüíñüôè GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed evening. oh yeah and this verse from Chapter 7 is definitely very good
