i prayed for rain yesterday, and we had a little rain tonight and GOD waked me up by thunder and showed me the little rain. it lasted literally around a few minutes it felt like and it was definitely just for me. O Lord Jesus Christ my Almighty GOD how Wonderful and Perfect You Are Lord Jesus Christ i cannot even begin imagining. please help all people repent and come to You Lord GOD. please Holy Spirit move in their lives and convict them Father GOD. please let them not care about religion but about You Lord Jesus Christ because You dont care about religion - You care about people and their relationship with You Lord GOD. please forgive me all my sins and mistakes and iniquities and transgressions, please wash me clean with the Holy Blood of Your Perfect Righteous Son our Lord Jesus Christ. thank You so much Father GOD for taking care of me and my family. all we can do is thank You Lord Jesus Christ. You are all we've got and we dont need nothing else. please let us all be born again followers of You Christ Jesus our Holy Lord GOD. also the clouds come upon the face of the heavens now so it seems its about to rain today again. Lord Jesus i love You so much Father GOD thank You so much for loving me so much. in Jesus Holy Name Amen 💗✝️🙏
