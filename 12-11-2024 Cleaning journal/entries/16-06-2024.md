and after playing those games like when, Daddy Jesus please protect me Father GOD, im being attacked by the wicked enemy, Father Jesus Christ please help

thank You so much Daddy Jesus Christ i love You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️💖

okay so while playing those games it felt good for a while but then after some time i just got bored and stopped playing, Jesus Lord please help me

why do we lust Father GOD? i been watching a lot of Tim Wildsmith lately on youtube with all the crazy expensive luxury Bible reviews he does and i honestly would love a premium Bible like that as well, but why? why do i want it? i will most likely not read it anyway at all because it's way easier to read on the phone or computer

why do i wanna play those games that ultimately don't satisfy me Father GOD?

please help me Daddy Jesus, i seem to be a Christian, but still my life doesn't seem fulfilling. in fact, i hate my life in this world Father GOD, it is such a wicked place, full of sin and all kinds of evil Daddy Jesus please all i want is for You to take me home Father GOD please Daddy Jesus, i want nothing in this world, this world is dead to me, i don't wanna be here anymore Father GOD please Daddy Jesus have mercy on me Lord Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️💕 

what can i do to make this life more bearable in this world while You haven't taken me home yet Father GOD? surely no material stuff can ever satisfy me, it's a deceit. but what then? i read my Bible every day and i pray almost always yet still this life just hurts so much Father GOD please ease my pain Daddy Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️💗

Hallelujah thank You Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ✝️ i know Daddy Jesus Christ that You are good Father GOD so ill trust You Daddy Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty till the very end
