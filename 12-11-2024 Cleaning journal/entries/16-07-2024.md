**Who has believed our message?
And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?
For He grew up before Him like a tender shoot,
And like a root out of parched ground;
He has no stately form or majesty
That we should look upon Him,
Nor appearance that we should be attracted to Him.
He was despised and forsaken of men,
A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
And like one from whom men hide their face
He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.
	
Surely our griefs He Himself bore,
And our sorrows He carried;
Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken,
Smitten of God, and afflicted.
But He was pierced through for our transgressions,
He was crushed for our iniquities;
The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
And by His scourging we are healed.
All of us like sheep have gone astray,
Each of us has turned to his own way;
But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all
To fall on Him.
	
He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
Yet He did not open His mouth;
Like a lamb that is led to slaughter,
And like a sheep that is silent before its shearers,
So He did not open His mouth.
By oppression and judgment He was taken away;
And as for His generation, who considered
That He was cut off out of the land of the living
For the transgression of my people, to whom the stroke was due?
His grave was assigned with wicked men,
Yet He was with a rich man in His death,
Because He had done no violence,
Nor was there any deceit in His mouth.**
‚Äé 
```
```
**But the LORD was pleased
To crush Him, putting Him to grief;
If He would render Himself as a guilt offering,
He will see His offspring,
He will prolong His days,
And the good pleasure of the LORD will prosper in His hand.
As a result of the anguish of His soul,
He will see it and be satisfied;
By His knowledge the Righteous One,
My Servant, will justify the many,
As He will bear their iniquities.
Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great,
And He will divide the booty with the strong;
Because He poured out Himself to death,
And was numbered with the transgressors;
Yet He Himself bore the sin of many,
And interceded for the transgressors.**
‚Äî Isaiah 53
```
```
Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father but through Me.
‚Äî John 14:6 ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè

He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.‚Äù

##### JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS spoke to me thank YOU JESUS my LORD and my GOD
**‚ÄúO afflicted one, storm-tossed, and not comforted,
Behold, I will set your stones in antimony,
And your foundations I will lay in sapphires.
‚ÄúMoreover, I will make your battlements of rubies,
And your gates of crystal,
And your entire wall of precious stones.
‚ÄúAll your sons will be taught of the LORD;
And the well-being of your sons will be great.
‚ÄúIn righteousness you will be established;
You will be far from oppression, for you will not fear;
And from terror, for it will not come near you.
‚ÄúIf anyone fiercely assails you it will not be from Me.
Whoever assails you will fall because of you.
‚ÄúBehold, I Myself have created the smith who blows the fire of coals
And brings out a weapon for its work;
And I have created the destroyer to ruin.
‚ÄúNo weapon that is formed against you will prosper;
And every tongue that accuses you in judgment you will condemn.
This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD,
And their vindication is from Me,‚Äù declares the LORD.**
‚Äî Isaiah 54:11-17
```
Seek the LORD while He may be found;
Call upon Him while He is near.
Let the wicked forsake his way
And the unrighteous man his thoughts;
And let him return to the LORD,
And He will have compassion on him,
And to our God,
For He will abundantly pardon.
‚ÄúFor My thoughts are not your thoughts,
Nor are your ways My ways,‚Äù declares the LORD.
‚ÄúFor as the heavens are higher than the earth,
So are My ways higher than your ways
And My thoughts than your thoughts.
‚Äî Isaiah 55:6-9

Nor devastation or destruction within your borders;
But you will call your walls salvation, and your gates praise.
‚ÄúNo longer will you have the sun for light by day,
Nor for brightness will the moon give you light;
But you will have the LORD for an everlasting light,
And your God for your glory.
‚ÄúYour sun will no longer set,
Nor will your moon wane;
For you will have the LORD for an everlasting light,
And the days of your mourning will be over.
‚ÄúThen all your people will be righteous;
They will possess the land forever,
The branch of My planting,
The work of My hands,
That I may be glorified.
‚ÄúThe smallest one will become a clan,
And the least one a mighty nation.
I, the LORD, will hasten it in its time.‚Äù**
