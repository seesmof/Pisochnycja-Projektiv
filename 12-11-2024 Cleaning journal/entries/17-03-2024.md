Good morning Lord Jesus Christ my Holy God Almighty King Jesus Christ our Lord
Not the best morning cause something very awful happened in it
When i was asleep i was seeing a dream and in that dream i whispered out loud a horrible blasphemy taking God's name in vein
And so yeah that was absolutely horrible, Lord God i am so sorry Lord Jesus Christ please forgive me for that horrendous sin Lord God
As soon as i said it i woke up immediately
And im pretty sure i said that in real life as well
Why would i do that?
i think God is telling me that it wasn't me who said that, but who else has control over my body?
Should i research this Lord God?
