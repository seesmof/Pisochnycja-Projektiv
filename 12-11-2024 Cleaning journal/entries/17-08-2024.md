HALLELUJAH THANK YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS!

thats amazing brother Marvin, praise JESUS. GOD helped me start doing sports recently also. here‚Äôs what we been doing for a few days now:

one set (meaning once we finish all of those exercises, we don‚Äôt do them once again) with each exercise until failure (meaning we do each exercise the maximum number of times we can, we continue the exercise until we cannot do it anymore). here are the exercises:

### pullups

> ![HALLELUJAH THANK YOU JESUS](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Pullup.gif)

this one might be tricky if you don‚Äôt have a pullup bar at home or anywhere near. if you dont, do the superman exercise:

### pushups

> ![HALLELUJAH THANK YOU JESUS](https://media1.tenor.com/m/7RrdzMurW8IAAAAC/pushups.gif)

this one can be done probably anywhere. quite easy to do, but also easy to injure a shoulder, thats what i did, so be very careful to follow the proper technique. tuck your elbows as close to the torso as possible and make sure to do a warmup before you start the workout

### squats

> ![HALLELUJAH THANK YOU JESUS](https://media1.tenor.com/m/U34I2zSass0AAAAd/squat-james-smith.gif)

also can be done probably anywhere. very easy to do. if it feels too easy, try holding something heavy in the hands or doing a little jump after you reach the top position of the squat. or even both

you dont have to hold your hands up like that by the way. probably, at least i dont

GOD bless you brother, i pray and hope that helps ‚úùÔ∏èüíû may JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS grant you an amazingly blessed day today and forevermore

touching when something hurts won't make it to away but can even make it worse

yeah we have daily notes also and literature notes would be nice to have
so right now our vault project structure is like this
- 0 HOLY BIBLE/ - our AMP BIBLE is here
- 1 note/ - all the notes are here
	- id/ - notes related to password or codes
	- university/ - university related stuff. just a few notes there for now but there will probably be more eventually, so not sure what to do with it yet
	- verse/ - BIBLE verses studies
	- and all the other notes are pretty much just in this folder, not organized in any way
- daily/ - our daily notes
- file/ - our files
- template/ - our templates
- blessings - counting blessings from JESUS quick access note
- shops - quick access note for shopping list
- questions - quick access note to write down questions that interest us
- prayers - our prayer list for people
- ideas - HOLY SPIRIT giving us ideas for potential learning
and so since we can now have all those different types of notes, how should we organize it all?
