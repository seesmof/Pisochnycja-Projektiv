Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them. When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes. He issued a proclamation and it said, “In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water. But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands. Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish.” 	When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it.
— Jonah 3:5-10

Ніневітяни повірили Богові, – від найстаршого й до найменшого, – оголосили піст і одяглись у веретища. Ця вістка дійшла до царя Ніневії. Він устав зі свого трону, зняв із себе свою царську мантію, одягнувся у веретище й сів посеред попелу. Він звелів оголосити в Ніневії постанову царя і його вельмож, наказуючи: Жодна людина і жодна тварина, воли й вівці, не повинні нічого їсти, не пастися і не пити води! Нехай буде веретище на людях і худобі, й нехай щиро волають до Бога. Хай кожен відвернеться від своєї лихої дороги та від беззаконних учинків своїх рук. Хто знає, може якраз Бог зглянеться і відверне від нас Свій палкий гнів та обурення, – і ми не загинемо!? Коли ж Бог побачив їхні вчинки, а також те, що вони звернули зі своєї злочинної дороги, то Бог змилосердився над ними і скасував те лихо, що мав учинити, – і не допустив його.
— Йони 3:5-10

How to end the war?

GOD has already given us all the instructions we need, we just gotta take heed:

Then the people of Nineveh believed in God; and they called a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest to the least of them. When the word reached the king of Nineveh, he arose from his throne, laid aside his robe from him, covered himself with sackcloth and sat on the ashes. He issued a proclamation and it said, “In Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles: Do not let man, beast, herd, or flock taste a thing. Do not let them eat or drink water. But both man and beast must be covered with sackcloth; and let men call on God earnestly that each may turn from his wicked way and from the violence which is in his hands. Who knows, God may turn and relent and withdraw His burning anger so that we will not perish.” 	When God saw their deeds, that they turned from their wicked way, then God relented concerning the calamity which He had declared He would bring upon them. And He did not do it.

why do i need to repent?

because *for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God* (Romans 3:23) and *For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.* (Romans 6:23)

and

guys the only way to end the war in Ukraine is for the entire nation to genuinely repent - turn away from their sins, plead and beg GOD our Lord Almighty Savior Jesus Christ for forgiveness and for mercy for our souls and for our country, and also to actively seek GOD and to seek the Will of Jesus Christ for our lives. this is the only way to end these tribulations for us and the only way to reconcile us with GOD - the Perfect Man and our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. only He, being perfect GOD - fully GOD and fully Man, is able to reconcile us with GOD the Father. just like Jesus our Lord says in John 14:6:

> Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. - John 14:6

and the way to come to Jesus is very simple - GOD didnt make it complicated at all. be genuine, look at your life and how many times you have sinner. use the Ten Commandments - or the Moral Law of GOD, as the baseline for validation, here they are:

> “You shall have no other gods before Me.
> “You shall not make for yourself an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth. You shall not worship them nor serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, inflicting the punishment of the fathers on the children, on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing favor to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My commandments.
> “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.
> “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. For six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of the Lord your God; _on it_ you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male slave or your female slave, or your cattle, or your resident who stays with you. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and He rested on the seventh day; for that reason the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
> “Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged on the land which the Lord your God gives you.
> “You shall not murder.
> “You shall not commit adultery.
> “You shall not steal.
> “You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
> “You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male slave, or his female slave, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
> — Exodus 20:3-17

so if you genuinely assess yourself and your life, im absolutely certain you will find at least a few of those commandments broken, for GOD tells us in Romans 6:23

> for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, - Romans 6:23
