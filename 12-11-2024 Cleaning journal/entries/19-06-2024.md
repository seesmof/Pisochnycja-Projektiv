guys the feature you just added to your vscode codeium extension is really bothersome, i dont like how on each line that i hover with my mouse some plus gray thing appears to the left and that gray line is just taking up unnecessary space. please add an ability to turn it off ✝️💗

GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed day ✝️💞🙏

get saved from hell; repent (turn away) from your sins and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ ✝️❣️🤲

**Though youths grow weary and tired,
And vigorous young men stumble badly,
Yet those who wait for the Lord
Will gain new strength;
They will mount up with wings like eagles,
They will run and not get tired,
They will walk and not become weary.**
— [Isaiah 40:30-31](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2040:30-31&version=NASB,KJV>)

**What then shall we say to these things? If God _is_ for us, who _is_ against us?**
