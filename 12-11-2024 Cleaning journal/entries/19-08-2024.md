JESUS help me trust YOU more please

what makes me happy:
- food 
- watching youtube
- seeing beautiful weather
what makes GOD happy
- Gospel being preached
- people being saved
- people repenting
those two dont sync up
why? how to sync them up?
what makes YOU Happy JESUS doesnt make me happy, why?

im anxious for most of today because JESUS i think put on my heart to ask a cashier in the supermarket whether they talk to JESUS
and i been anxious because i dont really wanna do it
but JESUS loves a cheerful giver

GOD has been leading me to find resources like John Piper’s books and materials on Christian Hedonism and today also George Muller’s way to pray how JESUS revealed to him the meaning of ![[Psalm 81#10]]
and the phrase “Open your moth wide and I Will fill it”
and Muller asked JESUS to provide for his orphanage house all he needed and GOD did, of course HE did
why cant i trust YOU like that JESUS please help
joy, is joy important?
how to have joy? why dont i have joy?
JESUS YOU led me to a video from REAL BIBLE Believers youtube channel, our brother Brandon gave it to us, and they say a very important point that really struck me there that a way to get our prayers answered is by synching up those two fields: what makes me happy and does that align with GOD, would that make HIM Happy? 
JESUS i have no idea how to do that FATHER GOD
things that please YOU are not comfortable
why would i seek comfort? because im in the flesh
how to kill the flesh? by walking in the HOLY SPIRIT
how to walk in the HOLY SPIRIT? trust in JESUS and be obedient to HIS Commands
so the only way to get out of this is to just keep doing YOUR Will FATHER GOD no matter how painful and depressing it might be
at least after we have done YOUR Will, we have peace
JESUS am i wrong?
i have no idea what to do FATHER GOD help me JESUS please

okay 
why cant i trust GOD?
i think one of the reasons may be because i dont fully know if im going to heaven or not
JESUS help please
why am i not sure im going to heaven?
do i think GOD can lie? no
didnt i have a profound spiritual experience in the beginning of this year that whenever i was going outside i was simply overflowing with joy? JESUS even helped me write an article on that

there must be something wrong with our doctrines JESUS HELP
if our joy goes away, its either sin or doctrine, as our [brothers here tell us](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/joyless-christianity-is-dangerous#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20first%20effects%20of%20sin%20or%20doctrinal%20error%20is%20that%20we%20lose%20our%20joy%20in%20Christ.)
JESUS help me identify what doctrine i get wrong
works
do i think my works earn my salvation?
why then cant i have peace if i dont do anything for YOU JESUS?
cant i have peace?
didnt we do anything for JESUS yesterday, well outside i mean, except feeding the birdies, not really spreading the Gospel in any way, and yet we did have peace
what if those callings are not from GOD?
i never thought of that
or maybe i did but didnt pay attention
we are close to the breakthrough
HALLELUJAH JESUS THANK YOU JESUS
okay lets focus JESUS HELP
works
why do we work?
to please JESUS and to earn our rewards?
why cant we not work?
because im afraid of what JESUS said that if one knows the will of THE FATHER and doesnt do it, to him it is sin
woah this is deep JESUS i need a lot of help
i cant figure it out on my own FATHER GOD
JESUS please help

JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
HALLELUJAH
we must pursue the fruits of THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD ALMIGHTY

HALLELUJAH JESUS THAKN YOU JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH JESUS THAKN YOU JESUS THANK YOU JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
![[Habakkuk 3#17]]
![[Habakkuk 3#18]]

JESUS WOW
JESUS JESUS THANK YOU JESUS
JESUS please write this down for future generations
i was surfing on the web asking JESUS to help me
because i lost my joy long ago
and suddenly i lost control and gave it all over to the HOLY SPIRIT
my hands opened the search bar and started typing
earlier this week, or last week i think, we set our default search engine to SearchFind, JESUS we praise YOUR HOLY NAME for this amazing Find!
we created multiple tabs with queries like joy, obedience, faith, trust, hope and reliance on GOD
JESUS led us to a few articles on joy from [Ligonier](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/greatest-joy), [gotQuestion](https://www.gotquestions.org/fruit-Holy-Spirit-joy.html) and [desiringGOD](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/joyless-christianity-is-dangerous)
the desiring GOD resources have become a great source of JESUS’ help for me in the last few days
earlier today we searched for some encouragement on joy after talking to our brother Brandon about it, JESUS may he be blessed forever
and he gave us a video from REAL BIBLE Believers with a good point we learned from there that our joy and GOD’s Pleasure should be in sync
and then we searched for something, i dont even remember what, but JESUS led us to a video about how George Muller prayed to JESUS for blessings after praying for GOD’s WILL to be done in his situation with orphanage house
and JESUS led him to [Psalm 81:10](https://www.bible.com/bible/3345/PSA.81.10) and then he started asking specific things
so we asked JESUS today to grant us a trip to our village
as with the Muller’s example, we didnt ask to a specific date, we just asked that JESUS would please grant us that request because GOD can do all things
and HE will, because GOD is GOOD
please JESUS remind us to write down here when YOU grant us our request so that our joy may be complete FATHER GOD
in YOU JESUS we trust and in YOU is our fullness of joy and at YOUR RIGHT HAND are Pleasures forevermore HALLELUJAH
yeah and so JESUS led us to [this amazing article](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/joyless-christianity-is-dangerous) that probably helped the most so far
well of course it is JESUS who helps, but through this article GOD helped us a lot!
especially this section [Joy protects from religion](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/joyless-christianity-is-dangerous#joy-protects-from-religion), this is very important
because our good works lately, JESUS i confess forgive me please FATHER GOD, our good works lately were definitely for the wrong reason
they were not worshipful of JESUS, they were burdensome and duty-driven, religious to put it simply
wow JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
*If you lose your joy, that could be a sign that your work for the Lord is no longer worship* this!
wow JESUS thats probably the answer FATHER GOD
wow JESUS please i beg YOU JESUS let all my works be worship of YOU JESUS
please JESUS grant us that request we beg YOU FATHER GOD
in JESUS HOLY NAME we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY
AMEN
oh yeah and why i mentioned that article is because miraculously JESUS connects it all together by bringing up George Muller in this article also
wow JESUS i love YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
*George Müller was an evangelist and orphanage director in Bristol, England* the article says
JESUS WOW JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
*Working hard for Jesus — even caring for thousands of orphans — is a cold and empty duty if we have lost the warmth of our love for Christ. Joy keeps you safe from serving as a religious duty.*
this is what we need
and also a quote from our brother Muller
*I saw more clearly than ever that the first great and primary business to which I ought to attend every day was to have my soul happy in the Lord. ==The first thing to be concerned about was not how much I might serve the Lord but how I might get my soul into a happy state==, and how the inner life might be nourished.*
JESUS that is what we need to focus on
now how much to serve YOU
but how to rejoice in YOU
and service and works will flow naturally as a continuation of that worship
JESUS WOW
JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
*A joyful believer is already more than satisfied in Christ — what more could he possibly want? Make it a point to be satisfied in Christ so that you ==rejoice in the Lord==, and you will find safety and strength in your fight against sin.*
JESUS THAKN YOU JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH

JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH

JESUS THANK YOU JESUS
JESUS please help me be very humble and lowly and give Glory to YOU Always JESUS
JESUS please help me be grateful and joyful FATHER GOD always FATHER GOD in JESUS HOLY NAME AMEN

JESUS THANK YOU for giving me YOUR Faith FATHER GOD
JESUS THANK YOU JESUS THANK YOU JESUS LORD JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
