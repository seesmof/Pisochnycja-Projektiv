Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. - Matthew 5:6

So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness. - Colossians 2:6-7

Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. - Matthew 11:28

By day the Lord directs his love, at night his song is with me— a prayer to the God of my life. - Psalm 42:8
