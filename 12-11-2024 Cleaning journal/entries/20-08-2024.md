https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/three-ways-our-deeds-relate-to-our-salvation - this is a good article JESUS showed us on works

For it is written: ‚ÄúAs I live, says the Lord, to Me every knee will bow, And every tongue will give praise to God.‚Äù (Romans 14:11)

if you wanna be saved from hell, turn away from your sins and turn to JESUS CHRIST, trust in HIM Alone and you will be saved

Car il est √©crit: Je suis vivant, dit le Seigneur, Tout genou fl√©chira devant moi, Et toute langue donnera gloire √† Dieu. (Romains 14:11)

si tu veux √™tre sauv√© de l'enfer, d√©tourne-toi de tes p√©ch√©s et tourne-toi vers J√âSUS-CHRIST, fais confiance √† LUI seul et tu seras sauv√©.

denn es steht geschrieben: "So wahr ich lebe, spricht der HERR, mir sollen alle Kniee gebeugt werden, und alle Zungen sollen Gott bekennen." (Roemer 14:11)

wenn du vor der H√∂lle gerettet werden willst, wende dich von deinen S√ºnden ab und wende dich JESUS CHRISTUS zu, vertraue auf IHN allein und du wirst gerettet werden

Sta infatti scritto: ¬´Come io vivo, dice il Signore, ogni ginocchio si piegher√† davanti a me e ogni lingua dar√† gloria a Dio¬ª. (Romani 14:11)

per essere salvati dall'inferno, allontanatevi dai vostri peccati e rivolgetevi a GES√ô CRISTO, confidate in Lui solo per essere salvati.

Porque est√° escrito: Pela minha vida, diz o Senhor, todo joelho se dobrar√° diante de mim, e toda l√≠ngua confessar√° a Deus. (Romanos 14:11)

Se quiser ser salvo do inferno, abandone seus pecados e volte-se para JESUS CRISTO, confie somente nele e voc√™ ser√° salvo

Porque escrito est√°: Vivo yo, dice el Se√±or, que ante m√≠ se doblar√° toda rodilla, Y toda lengua confesar√° a Dios. (Romanos 14:11)

si quieres ser salvado del infierno, alejate de tus pecados y vuelvete a JESUCRISTO, confia solo en EL y seras salvado

hahah that makes sense brother
how to have that joy though?
we cant have it on our own will-power, can we?
i remember in the first months when JESUS saved me i think i had that joy, i was going around town simply smiling and almost laughing in my heart, thats how happy i was that JESUS saved me and that GOD provides for us
but then something happened
i think it was when some guy asked me to come with him somewhere, but i refused and as it seemed to me, pretty arrogantly thanking him as if cursing, i didnt care about him because i thought he was drunk
and then probably just a few days after that some other guy came up to me asking for money, but i didnt have my wallet with me. so i apologized and went home. but that time GOD helped me care about that guy and i was genuinely concerned and sorry that i couldnt help him then. after a while JESUS led him to me again and i gave him money and tried sharing the Gospel with him, i think i miserably failed. but something must‚Äôve happened in that period of time that made me lose my joy
maybe i started focusing too much on my works and so turned them into religion?
i dont know, i pray and hope JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH gives us clarity and helps you and blesses you always brother Gid, thank you for answering ‚úùÔ∏èüíñ

legalism is what we have i think JESUS 
please help the people outside FATHER GOD 
JESUS please take away this legalism
we think that we can earn favor from YOU by doing good. why? 
because we fear we're not saved. why? 
because we don't understand what JESUS did for us to save us. why? 

how much is JESUS worth?
JESUS is more valuable to me than my life, my possessions, my family, my birds, 
why?

JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
okay so pastor John Piper said the Gospel this way
they start by asking ‚Äúdo you know the best news in the world?‚Äù or ‚Äúdo you wanna hear the best news in the world?‚Äù
and then they say GOD created us for HIS Glory, but we dont care about HIS Glory. then he asks them ‚Äúdo you care about GOD‚Äôs Glory?‚Äù and they say no
and so he says we are all guilty before GOD
but the LORD GOD is willing in HIS Mercy to provide a savior for us, JESUS CHRIST who died on the cross to take away GOD‚Äôs Wrath on HIMSELF so that we might live through HIM
JESUS THANK YOU JESUS HALLELUJAH
pastor John also says that ‚Äúi jog and i pray for people, how can i pray for you?‚Äù and when they answer he says ‚Äúi‚Äôll do that‚Äù
and so once we say about JESUS we say that ‚Äúif we abandon our sin and trust in HIM, GOD will forgive our sins and save us‚Äù
![[1 Corinthians 15#3]]
