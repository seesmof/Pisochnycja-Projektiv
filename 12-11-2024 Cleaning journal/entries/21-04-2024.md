for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me. that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; for “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” For by grace you have been saved through faith; and this is not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
