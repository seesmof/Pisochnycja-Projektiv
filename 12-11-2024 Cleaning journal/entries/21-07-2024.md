**“But you trusted in your beauty and became unfaithful because of your fame, and you poured out your obscene practices on every passer-by to whom it might be tempting. You took some of your clothes, made for yourself high places of various colors, and committed prostitution on them, which should not come about nor happen. You also took your beautiful jewels made of My gold and of My silver, which I had given you, and made for yourself male images so that you might commit prostitution with them. Then you took your colorfully woven cloth and covered them, and offered My oil and My incense before them. Also My bread which I gave you, fine flour, oil, and honey with which I fed you, you would offer before them for a soothing aroma; so it happened,” declares the Lord God. “Furthermore, you took your sons and daughters whom you had borne to Me and sacrificed them to idols to be devoured. Were your obscene practices a trivial matter? You slaughtered My children and offered them to idols by making them pass through the fire. And besides all your abominations and obscene practices, you did not remember the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare and squirming in your blood.**
~ Ezekiel 16:15-22
