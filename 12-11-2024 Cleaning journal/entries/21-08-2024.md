Love is patient. To be kind is love, not envious. Love doesn’t brag, and it isn’t puffed up. It doesn’t behave inappropriately, it isn’t self-seeking, it isn’t easily provoked, it doesn’t count up wrongs. It isn’t glad about injustice, but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, and endures all things.

JESUS help me work on my faith FATHER GOD
JESUS dont let me be a legalist ever FATHER GOD
JESUS help me know YOU, help me delight in YOU, help me cherish YOU JESUS
in JESUS HOLY NAME 
AMEN
