> [!bible]+ [Isaiah 40:18-20 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/23/40/)
>   To whom will you liken God? To what image will you compare Him?  To an idol that a craftsman casts and a metalworker overlays with gold and fits with silver chains?  To one bereft of an offering who chooses wood that will not rot, who seeks a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple?

JESUS spoke to us today
> [!bible]+ [Psalm 62:1-3 - BSB](https://bolls.life/BSB/19/62/)
>   For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him.  He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my fortress; I will never be shaken.  How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?
