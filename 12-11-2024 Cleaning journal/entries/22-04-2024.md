GOD has showed me that the Lord Jesus Christ our Holy GOD has no condemnation for me anymore
im trying to follow You Lord GOD im sure You see that, right?
and so i just trust You Lord Jesus that whatever happens with me it is for Your Glory and so that more people can come to Christ our Lord and to glorify You Lord GOD
please arrange things like that and use me in such a way that even me being present among people can be used by the Holy Spirit to convict people of their sins, please Father GOD
use me Lord Jesus Christ and help me to continue disciplining my flesh in obedience to Your Holy Spirit Lord GOD
i know and im certain that its all gonna be okay, cause You are in control Lord Jesus
and i know and im certain of that You will never leave us and You will never let us go Lord GOD
thank You so much Lord Jesus for being so good to us, im finally starting to understand grace - Your completely undeserved love and care and favor and providence
You are just so amazing Lord Jesus
please save my family King Jesus Christ 
we believe in You Lord GOD, and we all are trying our best in our own places where You've placed us Lord GOD
please use each and every one of us for Your Glory and Your Kingdom Lord GOD
