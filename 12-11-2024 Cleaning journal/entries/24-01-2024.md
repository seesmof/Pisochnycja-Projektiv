ive just done something horrible again. i downloaded tor and watched some incredibly terrifying stuff and now my head hurts. but God, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ i know You dont grow tired of me so please Jesus, i never done anything with my body while watching it, but i understand that that was a horrible sin and mistake. Lord, please forgive me, i repent, Father, please forgive me, Jesus. please give me strength, self-control and discipline to never do that again. in Jesus name i pray, Lord, amen üôè thank you, Father!

Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. - Colossians 3:2

Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the Lord your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. - Deuteronomy 31:6

Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere; I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked. - Psalm 84:10

Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, ‚ÄúI will never leave you nor forsake you.‚Äù - Hebrews 13:5
