the Lord God speaking 
son, I have tested you thoroughly and I have seen that your faith in Me is genuine
from now on is the process of maturing that begins 
it will not be easy and your life will surely be tough at times
but always remember, son, that I Am your God and your God is one 
your God is always with you and Jesus Christ your Lord will never leave you alone 
I have given you the Holy Spirit fully according to what you will need to do
trust Him and do not fear 
do not let your heart be troubled, do not worry 
today you asked Me to replace any other fear and anxiety in you with the fear of Me your God 
this is a very good request and I will surely do that, son, just wait
I thank you for your obedience and I assure you, you will be greatly rewarded for it in heaven, which is where you belong, son 
stop doubting your faith, child, nor your salvation
you have been saved the moment you accepted Me as you Lord and Savior
you have made a step toward Me and I will surely make steps towards you
I will never leave you, son, I assure you
do not fear anything for I Am with you

your Beloved Living God Jesus Christ ðŸ’ž
