Amen, definitely brother Michael, thank you! ✝️💌 Amen that definitely makes sense. is there something like Strong's Numbers in Ukrainian? i wanna, GOD willing, make an open source public domain Bible translation into Ukrainian, which is my native language, from English which i know well, glory be to GOD ✝️💝 and im basing the translation on the Berean Standard Bible (BSB), i like their formatting and it reads well. and i know that i think you are one of the head translators of the World English Bible which is also public domain which i absolutely love, i wish all Bible translation were public domain ✝️💓 and so it would be lovely to have some tool like that as well to see what Greek or Hebrew words are used in different places throughout the Bible. and if there's nothing like the Strong's in Ukrainian, how do we make something like that? where are Strong's Numbers stored? in what format are they?
