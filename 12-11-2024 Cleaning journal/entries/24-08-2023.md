привіт, друже. коротше день сьогодні непоганий. ну як непоганий, це м'яко сказано. так, я вирішив шо не буду мати так багато емоцій відтепер, бо це дуже заважає мені. так, значить сьогодні День Незалежності України. Слава Україні! Героям Слава! З днем незалежності, Україно! дуже важливий і класний день. прігожин, то якийсь додік московитьский, здох сьогодні, ГУР висадився на мис в Криму через воду, у московитів все палає, все горить, нищиться, клас. тепер, я хочу нормально зайнятись спортом, та? от, і хочу Push Pull Legs split нормально зробити, шо в мене понеділок вівторок середа push pull legs, четвер п'ятниця субота push pull legs і неділя відпочинок. бляха так шось я розвчився друкувати чи шо. аж якийсь resistance відчуваю. сука ще й слова забуваю всі. коротше все, okay i think this will be much faster and quicker. calm down now and tell me everything, okay? alright, so ive started watching clarkson's farm, pretty good. finished first season today and started season 2. as for now it has only 2 seasons, right? and so been doing that and also coding some stuff. i been getting familiar with ShadCN and i think by now i know it quite okay to start building out projects with it. in fact i already do. i rewrote Pixoto with it, still in progress. there's really not that much work there really. just gotta sit in there and fucking do it, you know? okay, so im terrible at writing in Ukrainian. well no shit, dude, you dont type in it like ever, and you mostly watching everything in English. and your family speaks ruzian most of the time between themselves. so no wonder you re not too good at Ukrainian, you know? but thats alright. it is always an opportunity for improving your english, you know? so dont be sad about it. it is sad but get over it. and typing in english is a lot faster too. i can formulate my thoughts much quicker. but this can change depending on the day though but yeah mostly english is just faster, and thats why i prefer it for journaling you know. well you can see how much stuff i wrote over there above in Ukrainian and yeah it is quite a lot, but you know like i said there are days when im better at Ukrainian and days when im better in english, it all depends on some yet unknown things to me.

okay, lets actually get down to business now, alright? okay, so tell me everything, how you feel? what are you feeling right now? well obviously since im yet to become a proper frontend developer with a position in some company ill proly always be feeling this glooming anxiety. i need to deal with it somehow. it is always there even on days like this one which turned out to be quite a bit productive. ive got a lot done today, from figuring our ShadCN to writing some custom snippets. regarding snippets, yeah? i started using this ShadCN UI Library and i noticed that its really good and i wanna use it in all my projects. cause my goal back then was to find out how i can develop and deploy apps faster. and i noticed one flaw that i had. i was always spending waaaay too much time on styling, you know? and i wanted to make everything completely perfect, flawless and thats what was hindering my progress. okay, and so

alright, so now you gotta decide what you gonna do with this evening of yours, right? cause right now its already 8pm, right? and you got only 2 hours left. so you either have a workout and having a chill nice little evening watching clarksons farm and stuff or you continue to code and all the good stuff for the rest of the time, right? so the choice is yours. but id rather go with coding, of course. since its easier than working out. yeah, fucking lazy twat, i know. but okay, ill start it the proper way from tomorrow, okay? alright, dont be frustrated or stressed or angry. it is okay, man. you got this. i know its bad that you cant get your workout in this day, but tomorrow is still the day, you know? nobody canceled it. well, unless i get a fucking intercontinental ballistic missile in my fucking window this night, you know? but thats alright, even if i do, that'd still be an experience, right? cause i was sitting in my couch, well laying honestly, and sorta listening to granparents while they were at the kitchen talking about something. and they were talking about someone in a manner that is very familiar to them, talking about the granny rn, so she was talking about someone with a sort of sense of regret in here voice for some reason. well the reason was that she didnt like the decisions the person made or whatever, but i could sense it, you know? i know her for quite some time now and in my concious normal life where i actually can think and reason and not just exist i figured out that she is extremely emotional, over the top. and so yeah she has that stuff when shes wining about some shit or she's complaining, you know? thats just the stuff she does, cannot do anything about it. but yeah that time i sensed it, and the reason i started sort of half-actively listening to them and what they say is i thought that person they were discussing was me. you know, still got those fucking trauma and a sense of extremely low self worth, so still thinking that somebody doesnt give a shit about me.

okay, just got interrupted by mom, she proposed me some fucking chemical nuts. and i didnt even look in there, i already knew it was some cheap shit for punks or idiots. anway, i got angry at her and raised my tone. i have to work on this, but i just dont know how. for some reason i find it easier to be aggressive. that way everybody listens to me and doesnt question anything twice. you know, i can convince people better. especially women. cause if i tell them, like my mom or a granny, you know, they have this shit when they think they have some say about what other person must do. you know, fucking ridiculous but they fucking have that and i hate it but what can i do? and they never get off me unless i make myself super clear. and so i, yeah, actually, lets explore this thing, cause i think i might be onto something here. so, as an example we will take a situation when we were out shopping for some clothes for me, you know? it was like a few months ago or something. already a 2023, but not summer. or maybe summer, anyway, dont give a shit. and so yeah, they were protesting regarding my color of choice for all the clothes i got which is black - a perfect universal color. and they were wining (mom particularly, of course, who else) all day long and all the time we were there that the fucking black is not the right color and i need something else. oh actually you know what i wanna explore this topic with AI, but after i finish in here, alright? okay, so yeah they were complaining and getting on my nerves about the fucking color of my clothes which ive chosen that day. and that really pissed me off. and for them to fuck off usually what it takes is a nice little rude af shout. i know, that is completely terrible and unnacceptable in any other place, obviously, but i just have to use this strategy cause it works. and reasoning doesnt fucking work. why you ask me? well fuck do i know? i dont. cause i tried it. and yeah, moving on, so were in the Ukraine shopping mall and we just went to Goldi store where i got myself some shorts and a T, and my mom was wining in there and after we left and so i gave this brilliant speech where my main point was that like i know you guys want the best for me, but i have my own opinions and fucking i decide what i buy for myself, you know? even though its your money. and guess what fucking happened after that. well your best guess would be that the wining stopped and she just accepted my choice and stopped getting on my nerves. fuck no. quite the opposite. it only continued all the way til home. thats why i just had to make a decision that ill never go shopping with them ever again. cause that just turned into a fucking disaster in no time. and so yeah, coming back home, to here and to the situation i just had, the interaction rather, i used shouting to convey my point. and thats exactly what my father, or step father rather, used throughout my childhood and thats what he uses these days too. when he doesnt get what he want out of the interaction, he starts convincing others and conveying his point by fucking shouting at the interlocutor (just translated that word, співрозмовник, what the fuck does that mean? interlocutor? companion also. dunno, fuck it). and yeah thats what i adopted. cause he practically raised me, right? i dont remember my real father which is too bad cause he gone mad when i was real young and i dont remember any of that including how he looks. so yeah, when i was listening to the song of Terror Reid i believe it was when he had a verse of something like "i was born with a mind of a mad man" that really stuck with me, cause i can relate lol. thats most likely not what he meant literally, but thats literally it for me, you know. so yeah thats that. i use fucking shouting at my mom to convey my point cause otherwise she'll be getting on my nerves trying to change my opinion and convince me otherwise any time she doesn't like my decision. and thats really fucking annoying and i hate that i have to do it but i do, cause nothing else works. alright, i think its time we explore this topic with our free therapist, aka ChatGPT, and see what he has to say on that.

okay so im tired of typing now so imma just go chill probably for the rest of the day and cya soon. i know we havent explored some other stuff i wanted like making custom snippets or fucking watching jeremy clarkson's farm, but next time, brother. later, peace out.
