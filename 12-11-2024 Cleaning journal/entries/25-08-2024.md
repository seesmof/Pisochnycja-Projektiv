JESUS YOU been showing us Passages from Scripture like from Romans 10: ![[Romans 10#18]] and now also from Romans 1: ![[Romans 1#20]]
that says to us that JESUS is known to all people
just some people choose to reject GOD and live without HIM
all we can do is live in such a way that shows how valueable JESUS truly is
JESUS let this be our mission we beg YOU LORD
JESUS let our works shine before all people to magnify YOU and to show how much we value YOU JESUS
but for that we surely need to grow in our appreciation of YOU JESUS
JESUS please help us do this exercise
what JESUS is doing for me right now:
GOD makes me see
JESUS lets me hear
GOD lets me type
JESUS lets me walk
GOD helps me smell
JESUS lets me live
GOD helps me breath
JESUS lets me have a family and a home
GOD helps me speak
JESUS gives me air
GOD helps me think
JESUS lets us live
