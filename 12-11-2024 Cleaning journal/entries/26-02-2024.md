‭2 ПЕТРА 3:3 CUV‬
[3]  Знайте насамперед те, що в останні дні прийдуть з насмішками кепкуни, які живуть за власними пожаданнями,

‭2 ПЕТРА 3:9 CUV‬
[9]  Не бариться Господь з обітницею, хоч це деякі вважають за зволікання, але є довготерпеливий до нас, не бажаючи, аби хтось загинув, а щоб усі прийшли до каяття.

‭2 ПЕТРА 3:13-15 CUV‬
[13]  Ми за Його обітницею чекаємо нових небес і нової землі, в яких проживає праведність. [14]  Тому, улюблені, очікуючи цього, постарайтеся, щоб Він знайшов вас у мирі, чистими і незаплямованими. [15]  А довготерпіння нашого Господа вважайте за спасіння, як і написав вам з притаманною йому мудрістю наш улюблений брат Павло, –

‭2 ПЕТРА 3:17-18 CUV‬
[17]  Тож ви, любі, заздалегідь знаючи про це, стережіться, щоб не були ви зведені оманою безбожних і не відступили від своєї непохитності, [18]  але зростайте в благодаті й пізнанні нашого Господа і Спасителя Ісуса Христа. Йому слава і нині, й у день вічний! Амінь.

**1 John 1 AMP**

5 This is the message [of God’s promised revelation] which we have heard from Him and now announce to you, that God is Light [He is holy, His message is truthful, He is perfect in righteousness], and in Him there is no darkness at all [no sin, no wickedness, no imperfection]. 6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him and yet walk in the darkness [of sin], we lie and do not practice the truth; 7 but if we [really] walk in the Light [that is, live each and every day in conformity with the precepts of God], as He Himself is in the Light, we have [true, unbroken] fellowship with one another [He with us, and we with Him], and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin [by erasing the stain of sin, keeping us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations].

8 If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude ourselves and the truth is not in us. [His word does not live in our hearts.] 9 If we [freely] admit that we have sinned _and_ confess our sins, He is faithful and just [true to His own nature and promises], and will forgive our sins and cleanse us _continually_ from all unrighteousness [our wrongdoing, everything not in conformity with His will and purpose]. 10 If we say that we have not sinned [refusing to admit acts of sin], we make Him [out to be] a liar [by contradicting Him] and His word is not in us.

**1 John 2**

1 My little children (believers, dear ones), I am writing you these things so that you will not sin _and_ violate God’s law. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate [who will intercede for us] with the Father: Jesus Christ the righteous [the upright, the just One, who conforms to the Father’s will in every way—purpose, thought, and action].

5 But whoever _habitually_ keeps His word _and_ obeys His precepts [and treasures His message in its entirety], in him the love of God has truly been perfected [it is completed and has reached maturity]. By this we know [for certain] that we are in Him:

6 whoever says he lives in Christ [that is, whoever says he has accepted Him as God and Savior] ought [as a moral obligation] to walk _and_ conduct himself just as He walked _and_ conducted Himself.

9 The one who says he is in the Light [in consistent fellowship with Christ] and yet [[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202&version=AMP#fen-AMP-30560a "See footnote a")]_habitually_ hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is in the darkness until now. 10 The one who [[b](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%202&version=AMP#fen-AMP-30561b "See footnote b")]loves _and_ unselfishly seeks the best for his [believing] brother lives in the Light, and in him there is no occasion for stumbling _or_ offense [he does not hurt the cause of Christ or lead others to sin]. 11 But the one who _habitually_ hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is in [spiritual] darkness and is walking in the darkness, and does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded his eyes.

24 As for you, let that remain in you [keeping in your hearts that message of salvation] which you heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you too will remain in the Son and in the Father [forever].

28 Now, little children (believers, dear ones), remain in Him [with unwavering faith], so that when He appears [at His return], we may have [perfect] confidence and not be ashamed and shrink away from Him at His coming. 29 If you know that He is _absolutely_ righteous, you know [for certain] that everyone who practices righteousness [doing what is right and conforming to God’s will] has been born of Him.

**1 John 3**

1 See what an incredible quality of love the Father has shown to us, that we would [be permitted to] be named _and_ called _and_ counted the children of God! And so we are! For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. 2 Beloved, we are [even here and] now children of God, and it is not yet made clear what we will be [after His coming]. We know that when He comes _and_ is revealed, we will [as His children] be like Him, because we will see Him just as He is [in all His glory]. 3 And everyone who has this hope [confidently placed] in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure (holy, undefiled, guiltless).

7 Little children (believers, dear ones), do not let anyone lead you astray. The one who practices righteousness [the one who strives to live a consistently honorable life—in private as well as in public—and to conform to God’s precepts] is righteous, just as He is righteous.

8 The one who practices sin [separating himself from God, and offending Him by acts of disobedience, indifference, or rebellion] is of the devil [and takes his inner character and moral values from him, not God]; for the devil has sinned _and_ violated God’s law from the beginning. The Son of God appeared for this purpose, to destroy the works of the devil.

9 No one who is born of God [deliberately, knowingly, and habitually] practices sin, because [[a](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%203&version=AMP#fen-AMP-30589a "See footnote a")]God’s seed [His principle of life, the essence of His righteous character] remains [permanently] in him [who is born again—who is reborn from above—spiritually transformed, renewed, and set apart for His purpose]; and he [who is born again] cannot _habitually_ [live a life characterized by] sin, because he is born of God _and_ longs to please Him.

11 For this is the message which you [believers] have heard from the beginning [of your relationship with Christ], that we should [unselfishly] love _and_ seek the best for one another; 12 and not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother [Abel]. And why did he murder him? Because Cain’s deeds were evil, and his brother’s were righteous.

15 Everyone who hates (works against) his brother [in Christ] is [at heart] a murderer [by God’s standards]; and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

16 By this we know [and have come to understand the depth and essence of His precious] love: that He [willingly] laid down His life for us [because He loved us]. And we ought to lay down our lives for the believers.




‭1 ІВАНА 4:9-11 CUV‬
[9]  Божа любов до нас виявилася в тому, що Бог послав Свого Єдинородного Сина у світ, щоб ми через Нього жили. [10]  Любов не в тому, що ми полюбили Бога, а в тому, що Він полюбив нас і послав Свого Сина як примирення за наші гріхи. [11]  Улюблені, коли Бог нас так полюбив, то й ми повинні любити одне одного!

‭1 ІВАНА 4:15 CUV‬
[15]  Коли хто визнає, що Ісус є Божий Син, то в ньому перебуває Бог, а він – у Бозі.

https://bible.com/bible/3786/1jn.4.15.CUV



‭1 ІВАНА 4:17-18 CUV‬
[17]  Таким чином, любов стала в нас досконалою, щоб ми мали сміливість у день суду, бо як Він, так і ми є в цьому світі. У любові немає страху, [18]  але досконала любов проганяє страх, оскільки страх несе страждання; хто ж боїться, той недосконалий у любові.

‭1 John 4:5 AMP‬
[5] They [who teach twisted doctrine] are of the world and belong to it; therefore they speak from the [viewpoint of the] world [with its immoral freedom and baseless theories—demanding compliance with their opinions and ridiculing the values of the upright], and the [gullible one of the] world listens closely and pays attention to them. 

https://bible.com/bible/1588/1jn.4.5.AMP



‭1 John 4:9 AMP‬
[9] By this the love of God was displayed in us, in that God has sent His [One and] only begotten Son [the One who is truly unique, the only One of His kind] into the world so that we might live through Him. 

https://bible.com/bible/1588/1jn.4.9.AMP



‭1 John 4:10 AMP‬
[10] In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation [that is, the atoning sacrifice, and the satisfying offering] for our sins [fulfilling God’s requirement for justice against sin and placating His wrath]. 

https://bible.com/bible/1588/1jn.4.10.AMP



‭1 John 4:11-12 AMP‬
[11] Beloved, if God so loved us [in this incredible way], we also ought to love one another. [12] No one has seen God at any time. But if we love one another [with unselfish concern], God abides in us, and His love [the love that is His essence abides in us and] is completed and perfected in us. 

https://bible.com/bible/1588/1jn.4.11.AMP



‭1 John 4:15-16 AMP‬
[15] Whoever confesses and acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. [16] We have come to know [by personal observation and experience], and have believed [with deep, consistent faith] the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides continually in him.
