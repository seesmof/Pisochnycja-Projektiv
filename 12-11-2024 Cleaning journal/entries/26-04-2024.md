Hallelujah guys, some great tools for reading and studying the Holy Bible that GOD helped me discover recently:

- [BibleWebApp.com](https://biblewebapp.com/study/): a great website with lots of translations and tools like commentaries, maps, media, videos, audio, verse comparisons, chapter analysis and lots of great useful stuff that can be opened in parallel with your main Bible text, completely free which is a huge blessing :heartpulse::cross::pray:
- [Biblia.com](https://biblia.com/books/nasb95/Ge1): a very good looking and useful website for reading the Bible along with some commentary open. the commentaries scroll with you as you read as well. the software is by Logos, so some stuff is behind a paywall, but the free stuff is quite enough as for me
- [ESV.org](https://www.esv.org/Genesis+1/): a very neat looking website that houses the ESV Bible translation with a good-looking user interface, free audio Bible, some reading plans and devotionals. very easy to read, lots of tools to highlight, comment, note and bookmark some verses, so if you're a fan of the ESV translation - this is great

also GOD showed me this very useful amazing little [Bible Reading Plan Generator](https://biblereadingplangenerator.com/?start=2024-04-26&total=140&format=calendar&order=chronological&daysofweek=1,2,3,4,5,6,7&books=OT,NT&lang=en&logic=words&checkbox=1&colors=1&dailypsalm=0&dailyproverb=0&otntoverlap=1&reverse=0&stats=1&dailystats=1&nodates=0&includeurls=1&urlsite=biblegateway&urlversion=AMP) website, lots of customization options there, i like it a lot
