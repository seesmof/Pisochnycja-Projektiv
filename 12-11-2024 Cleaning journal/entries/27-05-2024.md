**The Lord is my strength and my shield;
My heart trusts in Him, and I am helped;
Therefore my heart triumphs,
And with my song I shall thank Him.**
‚Äì [Psalm 28:7 NASB](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PS28.7&version=NASB,KJV>)

GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè recording your blessings is an excellent way to grow in faith i think: just taking some time in your day and opening up your journal (i like using obsidian for that, i can share my settings and how i set everything up in there, cause at first it might be a bit overwhelming, just text me in private guys) and just writing down the things that GOD blessed you with today or yesterday or in general. and that really helps you appreciate just how much the Lord Jesus takes care of you and provides for you always. for me for example: GOD gives us air to breathe, GOD makes sure we can blink with our eyelids, GOD gives us food to eat and GOD gives us water to drink, GOD gives us home to live in, GOD takes care of our work and studying tasks, GOD helps us find useful tools to speed up or ease the work, GOD blesses us with abilities to serve and take care of others, GOD gives us health and keeps us alive, GOD gives us water to wash in, glory be to Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè GOD bless you guys have an amazingly blessed day

**The Lord isn‚Äôt really being slow about His promise, as some people think. No, He is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent. (*2 Peter 3:9 NLT*); This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it: ‚ÄúChrist Jesus came into the world to save sinners‚Äù ‚Äî and I am the worst of them all. But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of His great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in Him and receive eternal life. (*1 Timothy 1:15-16 NLT*); ‚ÄúCome now, let‚Äôs settle this,‚Äù says the Lord. ‚ÄúThough your sins are like scarlet, I will make them as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, I will make them as white as wool. (*Isaiah 1:18 NLT*); Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put My Spirit within you and bring it about that you walk in My statutes, and are careful and follow My ordinances. (*Ezekiel 36:26-27 NASB*); So if you, despite being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him?‚Äù (*Luke 11:13 NASB*); ‚ÄúFor God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish, but have eternal life. (*John 3:16 NASB*); If you openly declare that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by openly declaring your faith that you are saved. (*Romans 10:9-10 NLT*); for ‚ÄúEveryone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.‚Äù (*Romans 10:13 NASB*); ‚ÄúThe time promised by God has come at last!‚Äù He announced. ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!‚Äù (*Mark 1:15 NLT*)**

Amen and Amen brother Alan thats good and most true ‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôè
