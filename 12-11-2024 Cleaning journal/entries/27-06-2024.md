##### Judges wife catching
**And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, ‚ÄúGo and lie in ambush in the vineyards and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, ‚ÄòGrant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty.‚Äô‚Äù**
‚Äî Judges 21:20-22

wife catching üòÑ that's amazing ‚úùÔ∏èüíï GOD bless you guys, praise Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty, have an amazingly blessed day üôè 

the Book of Judges was super amazing, very interesting history full of captivating stories ‚úùÔ∏è highly highly recommended, guys
##### Judges last verse explaining contents of the BOOK
**In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes.**
‚Äî Judges 21:25

the last verse in the Book of Judges pretty much explains all the crazy events in It guys, GOD just helped me notice that ‚úùÔ∏èüíó praise Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty, glory be to King Jesus Christ our Lord alone forever and ever
##### BSB cross-references detail
**Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach. But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.**
‚Äî 1 Timothy 5:7-8

one reason i love the Berean Standard Bible (BSB hereafter), apart from it being public domain, is their cross-referencing system: they don't use typical cross-references just in text all across the chapter, instead they put them either in footnotes or as linked sections. a linked section is pretty much some Scripture Passage from heading to heading that is somehow related to our current section, either parallel or by message. one example is Ruth 1:1-5 linking to 1 Timothy 5:3-16. lots of other references like that, especially in the Gospels, and that helps a lot, praise Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ‚úùÔ∏èüíì

also, very easy to read the BSB on BibleHub since all those references are actual links ‚úùÔ∏è

##### 1 Samuel 3:7 the Word of the LORD being Jesus
**Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.**
‚Äî 1 Samuel 3:7

i think the Word of the LORD here is Jesus, can it be? ‚úùÔ∏è might be also that maybe Samuel wasnt yet reading the Bible or any Scriptures that are now a part of the Bible, but the Word of the LORD or the Angel of the LORD is used a lot in the Old Testament to point to Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ‚úùÔ∏èüíñ

GOD bless you guys, be blessed forever ‚úùÔ∏èüíû

**And the LORD came and stood *there*, calling as at other times, ‚ÄúSamuel! Samuel!‚Äù And Samuel said, ‚ÄúSpeak, for your servant hears.‚Äù**

oh yea, verse 10 pretty much confirms it i think ‚úùÔ∏è the Word of the LORD being Jesus and here HE stands there and calls for Samuel ‚úùÔ∏èüíñ so amazing, praise Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty
##### 1 Samuel 3:20-21 additions to the Word of the LORD
**So all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD. And the LORD continued to appear at Shiloh, because there He revealed Himself to Samuel by His word.**

##### 1 Samuel 7 prayer does wonders
**Then Samuel said, ‚ÄúGather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you.‚Äù So they gathered at Mizpah and drew water and poured it out before the LORD and fasted on that day and said there, ‚ÄúWe have sinned against the LORD.‚Äù And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah. Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it, they were afraid of the Philistines. And the people of Israel said to Samuel, ‚ÄúDo not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines.‚Äù So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD. And Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him. As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel. But the LORD thundered with a mighty sound that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated before Israel. ... So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.**
‚Äî 1 Samuel 7:5-10,13

##### GOD choosing the lowly in 1 Samuel 9
**As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father‚Äôs house?‚Äù Saul answered, ‚ÄúAm I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my clan the humblest of all the clans of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?‚Äù 	Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons.**
‚Äî 1 Samuel 9:20-22

‚úùÔ∏èüíóüôèüèº this ties in perfectly into:

**But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.**
‚Äî 1 Corinthians 1:27-29
##### 1 Samuel 12:24-25 on repentance
**Only fear the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. For consider what great things he has done for you. But if you still do wickedly, you shall be swept away, both you and your king.‚Äù**
‚Äî 1 Samuel 12:24-25

##### texting twitch to see if we can make a bot account that wont get banned
Hallelujah thank YOU Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty ‚úùÔ∏èüíó GOD bless you guys, have an amazingly blessed day

okay so by GOD's Amazing Grace i tried making some twitch chat bots with python and twitchio but the only problem we had with those is that they were setup on the regular accounts and you guys tend to shadowban accounts if messaging too fast or frequent so is there any way to create an account that would be set apart as strictly bot and that wont get banned no matter the amount or frequency of the messages? any other tips if you have, please feel free to share

GOD bless you guys ‚úùÔ∏èüíì
