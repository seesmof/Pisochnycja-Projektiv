# figuring out Luke 7:36-50 what Simon was JESUS talking to
**Now one of the Pharisees was requesting Him to eat with him, and He entered the Pharisee‚Äôs house and reclined at the table. And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner; and when she learned that He was reclining at the table in the Pharisee‚Äôs house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume, and standing behind Him at His feet, weeping, she began to wet His feet with her tears, and she wiped them with the hair of her head, and began kissing His feet and anointing them with the perfume. Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he said to himself, ‚ÄúIf this man were a prophet He would know who and what sort of person this woman is who is touching Him, that she is a sinner!‚Äù**

**And Jesus responded and said to him, ‚ÄúSimon, I have something to say to you.‚Äù And he replied, ‚ÄúSay it, Teacher.‚Äù ‚ÄúA moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other, fifty. When they were unable to repay, he canceled the debts of both. So which of them will love him more?‚Äù Simon answered and said, ‚ÄúI assume the one for whom he canceled the greater debt.‚Äù And He said to him, ‚ÄúYou have judged correctly.‚Äù And turning toward the woman, He said to Simon, ‚ÄúDo you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has wet My feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave Me no kiss; but she has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in. You did not anoint My head with oil, but she anointed My feet with perfume. For this reason I say to you, her sins, which are many, have been forgiven, for she loved much; but the one who is forgiven little, loves little.‚Äù And He said to her, ‚ÄúYour sins have been forgiven.‚Äù And then those who were reclining at the table with Him began saying to themselves, ‚ÄúWho is this man who even forgives sins?‚Äù And He said to the woman, ‚ÄúYour faith has saved you; go in peace.‚Äù**

# BIBLE good verse
**Now as they were traveling along, He entered a village; and a woman named Martha welcomed Him into her home. She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord‚Äôs feet, listening to His word. But Martha was distracted with all her preparations; and she came up to Him and said, ‚ÄúLord, do You not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone? Then tell her to help me.‚Äù But the Lord answered and said to her, ‚ÄúMartha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things; but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.‚Äù**

# why do we seek entertainment DADDY JESUS?
FATHER GOD why do we lust for entertainment?
lately i been wanting to play fortnite again
but the more i look at others play it, the more horrible wicked sinful stuff i see there
not to mention that its literally a shooting game where you kill people, thats abominable
please DADDY JESUS help me understand why we have that and what to do with that
i been watching the OurLifeHomeschooling youtube channel i think is how its called
its about a wonderful Christian family with 12 kids i think who homeschool their kids and grow a lot of their own food
and so i just love watching them, especially doing something like working or resting outside or playing and stuff like that
so now i had a few thoughts of watching some movie, maybe without any voices that would just have some scenery of nature or rural America
something like that, why do we have that also DADDY JESUS?
i know that none of that stuff would satisfy me if i give in
i guess just gotta persevere and not give in DADDY JESUS right FATHER GOD?
thank YOU JESUS i love YOU LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY
please DADDY JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH protect us from the enemy
in JESUS HOLY NAME we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY
AMEN ‚úùÔ∏èüíì
# JESUS Transfiguration note
**About eight days after these sayings, He took along Peter, John, and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while He was praying, the appearance of His face became different, and His clothing became white and gleaming. And behold, two men were talking with Him; and they were Moses and Elijah, who, appearing in glory, were speaking of His departure, which He was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.**
~ [Luke 9.28-31](<https://www.bible.com/bible/2692/LUK.9.28-31>)

Hallelujah thank YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS ‚úùÔ∏èüíû
one interesting note on JESUS' Transfiguration from brother Phlo:
when JESUS our LORD was Transfigured on that mountain, HE was talking with Moses and Elijah 
and an interesting thing is that both Moses and Elijah talked with GOD on a mountain in the Old Testament:

**So He said, ‚ÄúGo out and stand on the mountain before the Lord.‚Äù And behold, the Lord was passing by! And a great and powerful wind was tearing out the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind there was an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. And after the earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire, a sound of a gentle blowing. When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice came to him and said, ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here, Elijah?‚Äù**
~ [1 Kings 19.11-13](<https://www.bible.com/bible/2692/1KI.19.11-13>)

**Then the Lord came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.**
~ [Exodus 19.20](<https://www.bible.com/bible/2692/EXO.19.20>)

GOD bless you guys, praise JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS ‚úùÔ∏èüíù
# choosing a Christian denomination
## Orthodox:
- They don't believe in the Papal Authority.
- The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone.
- Icons are to be venerated
- Prayer to saints are valid
- There are many mysteries in the church, that one ought to still believe regardless.
- Use tradition to interpret Scripture
- They believe in toll boths (dont know what that means ask an Ortho)

## Roman Catholic:
- Pope is good.
- Eucharist transforms into the body and blood of Christ
- Praying to saints good
- Purgatory is a thing
- Venerating Icons good
- Use tradition to interpret Scripture

## Protestant (High church):
- Eucharist is the body and blood of Christ (not transformed into His body).
- (Second option)Eucharist is spiritual
- Icons are okay for the most part
- No Venerating icons, no praying to saints.
- Tradition is fine as long as it doesn't go against Scripture (Scripture is held slightly higher than tradition)
- Baptism saves + infant baptism (for the most part)
- ***Exceptions***: Some High Church Protestants (Like Anglo-Catholics) adhere to veneration and prayer of Saints and Mary.

## Protestant (Low church):
- Icons aren't that good
- Baptism and the Eucharist are symbolical
- Scripture alone and individualistic learning is better.
- Tradition is spoken of very little.
