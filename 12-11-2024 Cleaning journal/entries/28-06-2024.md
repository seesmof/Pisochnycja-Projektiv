Тому то, як через одного чоловіка ввійшов до світу гріх, а гріхом смерть, так прийшла й смерть у всіх людей через те, що всі згрішили.
~ Римляни 5:12

спасайтеся від пекла: покайтеся від своїх гріхів та віруйте у Господа Ісуса Христа ✝️💓

Тому то, як через одного чоловіка ввійшов до світу гріх, а гріхом смерть, так прийшла й смерть у всіх людей через те, що всі згрішили. Гріх бо був у світі й до Закону, але гріх не ставиться в провину, коли немає Закону. Та смерть панувала від Адама аж до Мойсея і над тими, хто не згрішив, подібно переступу Адама, який є образ майбутнього.
~ Римляни 5:12-14

спасайтеся від пекла: покайтеся від своїх гріхів та віруйте у Господа Ісуса Христа ✝️💓

##### sending Passage from Psalm 34
**Oh, taste and see that the LORD is good!
Blessed is the man who takes refuge in him!
Oh, fear the LORD, you his saints,
for those who fear him have no lack!
The young lions suffer want and hunger;
but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
Come, O children, listen to me;
I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
What man is there who desires life
and loves many days, that he may see good?
Keep your tongue from evil
and your lips from speaking deceit.
Turn away from evil and do good;
seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of the LORD are toward the righteous
and his ears toward their cry.
The face of the LORD is against those who do evil,
to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
When the righteous cry for help, the LORD hears
and delivers them out of all their troubles.
The LORD is near to the brokenhearted
and saves the crushed in spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous,
but the LORD delivers him out of them all.
He keeps all his bones;
not one of them is broken.**
— [Psalm 34:8-20](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=PS34.8-20&version=NKJV,KJV>)
##### 1 Peter 1:15-16 message puts it nicely
**So roll up your sleeves, get your head in the game, be totally ready to receive the gift that’s coming when Jesus arrives. Don’t lazily slip back into those old grooves of evil, doing just what you feel like doing. You didn’t know any better then; you do now. As obedient children, let yourselves be pulled into a way of life shaped by God’s life, a life energetic and blazing with holiness. God said, “I am holy; you be holy.”**
~ [1 Peter 1:15-16 MSG](<https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1PE1.15-16&version=KJV,MSG>)

##### 1 Samuel 22 an evil spirit coming on Saul, scary, please Jesus dont ever give me that i beg YOU LORD
**Then the king sent _a messenger_ to summon Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household, the priests who were in Nob; and all of them came to the king. Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” And he replied, “Here I am, my lord.” Saul then said to him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, so that he would rise up against me by lying in ambush as _it is_ this day?”**

**Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, “And who among all your servants is as faithful as David, the king’s _own_ son-in-law, who is commander over your bodyguard, and is honored in your house? Did I _just_ begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute anything against his servant _or_ against any of the household of my father, because your servant knows nothing at all of this whole affair.” But the king said, “You shall certainly die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household!” And the king said to the guards who were attending him, “Turn around and put the priests of the Lord to death, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not inform me.” But the servants of the king were unwilling to reach out with their hands to attack the priests of the Lord. Then the king said to Doeg, “You, turn around and attack the priests!” And Doeg the Edomite turned around and attacked the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five men who wore the linen ephod. He also struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; _he_ also _struck_ oxen, donkeys, and sheep with the edge of the sword.**
~ 1 Samuel 22:11-19

**Now there was an evil spirit from the Lord on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing _the harp_ with _his_ hand.**
~ 1 Samuel 19:9

scary stuff, praise Jesus Christ our Lord GOD ✝️💗
