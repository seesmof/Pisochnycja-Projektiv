lots of people gathered there, a deceased person's name is Mykola (or Nikolaj)
some person giving a speech there was reading from the Bible
please pray for all those people to be saved
please pray for Mykola's family and friends for protection and salvation
such a crazy world
GOD bless you, i pray and hope JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY gives you a peaceful day ‚úùÔ∏èüíñ
