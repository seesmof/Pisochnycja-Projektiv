AMP Genesis 8:21 The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma [a soothing, satisfying scent] and the Lord said to Himself, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, **for the intent (strong inclination, desire) of man’s heart is wicked from his youth**; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done. -- the highlighted part is interesting, that confirms that people are all born in sin, even at those old times of Noah and his family. from the very second we are born - we are already sinners. which means we especially need Jesus to cleanse us and to wash us with the blood of the Lamb and to make us holy and perfect just as He, our Lord, is Holy and Perfect. not in this life though, but in the one to come. in this life it is our own job to prove and strength our faith by purifying ourselves and perfecting ourselves for God's sake. in Jesus Holy name

God revealed something amazing to me just now. Thank you so much Lord Jesus Christ our holy perfect righteous King above all Kings and Lord and Savior Jesus Christ our Heavenly Father God Jesus Christ Almighty Christ Jesus our Lord Jesus Christ our Heavenly Father our King of kings and Lord of Lords

Alrighty so since God is infinite, He is infinitely good. If God is infinitely good, it means there is nothing evil or bad in Him at all. And so evil is not something from God or created by God but rather an absence of God and of His majesty and goodness and glory. This is so beautiful thank you Lord Jesus Christ our Heavenly Father God our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ our King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Yeah i think thanks God i finally understand it

Oh wow and so this answers the question If God why evil. Cause evil is not from God, but rather it stems from the lack of God. So if a person is evil and does evil, they obviously don't know and lack God in their life. This is so incredible. The root of all our problems is truly our own disobedience

Lord God I'm so sorry i disobeyed you so much Lord Jesus Christ but i thank You and worship You and praise Your holy name Lord Jesus Christ because You saved me and washed me with the blood of the Lamb thank you so much Lord Jesus Christ our Heavenly Father God our King of Kings and Lord of Lords thank you so much Lord Jesus our Savior. So yeah we're saved cause our hope and our faith is confidently in Christ Jesus and we can fear nothing. He will guide us and He will direct us. God is the Living God - Jesus Christ is His name and He is always faithful and God is always righteous and faithful and God is infinitely good. God will never leave us nor will He forsake us so we have nothing to fear

Thank you so much Lord Jesus Christ for being so good and so faithful and so kind and so merciful and so incredible and for saving me Lord God thank you so much for saving such a sinner as me Lord Jesus Christ your mercy and grace is infinite and you are all i need Lord Jesus Christ i thank you and worship only you Lord Jesus Christ our Living God thanks a lot Lord Jesus our King of Kings and Lord of Lords in Jesus holy name i pray Lord God Amen and Amen 🙏💖✝️👑💞
