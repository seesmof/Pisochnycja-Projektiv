When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said,

“I am God Almighty;  
Walk [habitually] before Me [with integrity, knowing that you are always in My presence], and be blameless _and_ complete [in obedience to Me].

-- [Genesis 17:1 AMP](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=GEN17.1&version=AMP,KJV)
