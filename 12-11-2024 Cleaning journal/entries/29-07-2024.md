# JESUS and Thomas BIBLE sharing
**But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. So the other disciples were saying to him, ‚ÄúWe have seen the Lord!‚Äù But he said to them, ‚ÄúUnless I see in His hands the imprint of the nails, and put my finger into the place of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will not believe.‚Äù 

After eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in their midst and said, ‚ÄúPeace be with you.‚Äù Then He said to Thomas, ‚ÄúReach here with your finger, and see My hands; and reach here your hand and put it into My side; and do not be unbelieving, but believing.‚Äù Thomas answered and said to Him, ‚ÄúMy Lord and my God!‚Äù Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúBecause you have seen Me, have you believed? Blessed are they who did not see, and yet believed.‚Äù**
