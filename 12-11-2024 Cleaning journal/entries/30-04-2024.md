> Be to me a rock of refuge _and_ a sheltering stronghold to which I may continually come;  
> You have given the commandment to save me,  
> For You are my rock and my fortress.  
>   
> Rescue me, O my God, from the hand of the wicked (godless),  
> From the grasp of the unrighteous and ruthless man.  
>   
> For You are my hope;  
> O Lord God, _You are_ my trust _and_ the source of my confidence from my youth.
