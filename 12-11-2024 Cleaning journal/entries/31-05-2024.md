Jesus Christ my Holy Lord GOD Almighty i love You so much Father Jesus Christ our Lord GOD Most High
today are some not so pleasant news: twitch set chat for verified accounts only by default. or at least i think thats what they did
cause i dont think literally any and every channel we go to set a phone verification
cause yea the email is verified everywhere but the phone isnt
and i would love for it to be verified everywhere but my main account has been banned forever and so the phone is not available
so yea i think that ends our twitch evangelism Daddy Jesus
thats really sad
i shouldnt be sad cause GOD is with me and Jesus loves me very much
please Daddy Jesus our Beloved Father GOD Almighty please im begging You please save all of our family and all people of the world Father GOD 
in Jesus Holy Name we pray Lord GOD Amen

the best evangelistical technique is to **love** them *and* to **listen** to them
wow this is good

yea, our brother here ![](https://youtu.be/EP1pNR7g-Ho?t=750) tells extremely tells us that the best way is to love them and to listen to them and theres nothing i can do that will convert them to Christianity, just gotta pray for them and love them and listen to them
wow this is good, thank You so much Jesus Christ our Holy Lord GOD Almighty
