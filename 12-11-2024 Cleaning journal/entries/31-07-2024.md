life does feel meaningless, DADDY JESUS. we started that project where we create atomic notes and stuff, but where did it lead us? into even more, well i wouldnt call it depression, despair, thank YOU HOLY SPIRIT, yep despair is a better word. im just in despair DADDY JESUS, nothing in this world can ever satisfy me. DADDY JESUS i just wanna go home FATHER GOD, i pray for it im pretty sure every day now LORD JESUS. please DADDY JESUS let us go home to YOU.

gotta really try to simplify our life and to slow things down

![[1 John 5#13]]

there‚Äôs a youtube channel called needGOD.net and they go around online chats sharing the Gospel, but, they dont preach repentance and faith (or trust) alone in JESUS, they say to simply believe and trust that JESUS died for our sins

so is it repentance and faith or faith alone? i dont get that part

HOLY SPIRIT thank YOU LORD JESUS, thank YOU FATHER GOD for this amazing day today. thank YOU JESUS our LORD for Your Amazing Holy Grace, thank YOU FATHER GOD 

please JESUS why are we so tired? our soul is often in despair and worrying. i don't know if it's You calling us to do stuff Daddy JESUS or if it's just my imagination. well YOU control even our thoughts Daddy JESUS so surely those ideas are there for a reason. 

okay got it thank YOU JESUS. sometimes just feels so draining Daddy JESUS. thank YOU LORD, i wish Your day comes quicker Daddy JESUS, im so tired of this world Father GOD 

thank YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS for Your Amazing Grace LORD JESUS and thank YOU for helping us LORD GOD thank YOU JESUS for choosing us Father JESUS please teach us how to please YOU and how to worship YOU JESUS our HOLY LORD GOD MOST HIGH ‚úùÔ∏è üíó üôèüèº

emotions are very weird Daddy JESUS, i wish i didn't have them. no im sorry for praying that Daddy JESUS thank YOU HOLY SPIRIT for showing me. if GOD were to take my emotions away that would mean i wouldn't have love anymore. if that was the case we would be equal to nothing. please Daddy JESUS teach us instead to understand our emotions better and know if they're from YOU or not Daddy JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS

asceticism and GOD and how do YOU JESUS view asceticism Father GOD 

i still don't get it Daddy JESUS, how does the Book of Ecclesiastes fit into the Bible? it tells us to enjoy our lives for this is our reward. i don't want this to be my reward Daddy JESUS, i wanna receive all the rewards from YOU Father GOD once we come 

asked brother Brandon this question, DADDY JESUS, regarding how to live in this world and how to treat this world and whether to enjoy its pleasures or abstain from them (not sinful meaning of course), and YOU most definitely spoke through him there DADDY JESUS that was so awesome! here‚Äôs what he answered:

> The way I see it without delving into scripture at this moment, The Bible says to avoid sinful pleasures, but sunny days, food, etc etc, we‚Äôre supposed to enjoy these things and really have a good time, God doesn‚Äôt want us to suffer for but to be in joy, however he also wants us to work for Christ, which means suffering will come and we have to endure hardship. But it‚Äôs hardship for Christ not for the sake of it like some people live, life is for enjoying, where  you can. But ultimately living for Christ comes first so sometimes you have to give these things up. It‚Äôs all about staying sinless and doing your best for a Christ and enjoying life as much as possible where you can
> As long as you‚Äôre not sinning and still doing your work for Christ, have a ball brother ‚úùÔ∏è Trials will come naturally we don‚Äôt have to look for it lol

replaced an emojie with the cross there. but yea thats a good word there DADDY JESUS, thank YOU LORD! gotta find that balance somehow DADDY JESUS: to serve YOU as much as we can but to also enjoy this life somehow LORD JESUS, please teach us FATHER GOD. in JESUS HOLY NAME we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD MOST HIGH ‚úùÔ∏è AMEN

LORD JESUS thank YOU FATHER GOD for giving us amazing opportunities to listen to people. lately we been just going around some Christian discord servers and one day GOD showed us people talking in a server called Scripture Alone, and we joined and i think GOD met us with our brother Mat. his name is Matthew or Mat he says, he is originally from Switzerland but he moved to Thailand and married with his wife there, he has kids: one 11 years old and another 2,5 years old. he smokes weed and i feel very weird about it, and he also grows weed üòÖ so yea not sure if its from YOU Daddy JESUS or from the enemy. in any case please protect us DADDY JESUS ‚úùÔ∏èüíù LORD JESUS please bless our brother Mat greatly and also please bless our brother Elixmova from discord also, please DADDY JESUS save them all FATHER JESUS CHRIST in JESUS HOLY NAME we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING JESUS CHRIST our LORD ‚úùÔ∏è AMEN 

HALLELUJAH thank YOU JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS for feeding us! we ate some omlet, some marinated cucumbers and cheese, thank YOU JESUS! 

why do we enjoy music DADDY JESUS and why is there so many wicked music? is music considered entertainment FATHER GOD? i think so yea

our birdies tend to come up and fly up on our hand and wiggle their buts üòÑ thats hilarious im not sure why DADDY JESUS. and i was surprised today when Polly came up and did the same. i thought Kesha was doing that because of some instincts, but Polly came up today, thank YOU JESUS that was so amazing! thank YOU FATHER GOD

my head hurts now for some reason. we tried evangelizing a bit, but twitch is a very dangerous place. you can start watching the stream and that can distract you from actually spreading the Gospel. thank YOU JESUS!

was sitting with our brother Mat and this Eli guy, he‚Äôs from South Africa, they were talking and we were listening DADDY JESUS, thank YOU FATHER GOD for this amazing blessing DADDY JESUS

the birdie Polly came up on the edge of the cup and i prayed that YOU would protect her DADDY JESUS because water was not reachable by her beek unless she falls in. so i prayed that YOU would protect her from falling DADDY JESUS and YOU did! thank YOU FATHER GOD thank YOU JESUS, thank YOU LORD!

DADDY JESUS thank YOU for YOUR AMAZING GRACE FATHER GOD! thank YOU JESUS. so what is a better way to share the Gospel online quickly Daddy JESUS? we usually send something like ‚Äòget saved from hell! repent of your sins and believe on JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS‚Äô and then leave. but if we wanna talk, we ask them what they think happens after we die. we got that from our brother Ray Comfort, cool technique he got, thank YOU JESUS!

we‚Äôre having quite a good loving conversation with some guy from Germany or Scandinavia i think, and we try sharing the Gospel with him by just talking and he stopped reading our messages. DADDY JESUS please take full control and please save him and his family FATHER GOD in JESUS HOLY NAME we pray LORD GOD ALMIGHTY KING JESUS CHRIST our HOLY LORD MOST HIGH ‚úùÔ∏è AMEN
