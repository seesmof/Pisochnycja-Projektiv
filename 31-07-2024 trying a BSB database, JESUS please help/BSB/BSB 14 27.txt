Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His motherâ€™s name was Jerushah daughter of Zadok.
And he did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, just as his father Uzziah had done. In addition, he did not enter the temple of the LORD. But the people still behaved corruptly.
Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the house of the LORD, and he worked extensively on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
Jotham waged war against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them, and that year they gave him a hundred talents of silver, ten thousand cors of wheat, and ten thousand cors of barley. They paid him the same in the second and third years.
So Jotham grew powerful because he ordered his ways before the LORD his God.
As for the rest of the acts of Jotham, along with all his wars and his ways, they are indeed written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
And Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the City of David. And his son Ahaz reigned in his place.
