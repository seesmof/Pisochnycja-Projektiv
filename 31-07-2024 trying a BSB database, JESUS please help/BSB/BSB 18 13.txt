“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.
What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.
Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.
You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.
If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!
Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.
Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?
Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?
Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him like a man?
Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.
Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?
Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.
Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.
Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?
Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways to His face.
Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.
Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.
Behold, now that I have prepared my case, I know that I will be vindicated.
Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.
Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:
Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.
Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.
How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?
Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?
For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.
You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.
So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.
