Then Job answered:
“How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!
How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!
To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?
The dead tremble—those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them.
Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.
He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.
He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.
He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud.
He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.
The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.
By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.
By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”
