Then Elihu continued:
“Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning.
For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food.
Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.
Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’
What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?
He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.
For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’
Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly.
For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.
Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world?
If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath,
all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.
If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.
Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One,
who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’
who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands.
They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step.
There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide.
For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment.
He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.
Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.
He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,
because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways.
They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.
But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation,
that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.
Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.
Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’
Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed His? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know.
Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say:
‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’
If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.
For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”
