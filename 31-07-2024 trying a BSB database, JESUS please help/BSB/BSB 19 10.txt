Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide in times of trouble?
In pride the wicked pursue the needy; let them be caught in the schemes they devise.
For the wicked man boasts in the cravings of his heart; he blesses the greedy and reviles the LORD.
In his pride the wicked man does not seek Him; in all his schemes there is no God.
He is secure in his ways at all times; Your lofty judgments are far from him; he sneers at all his foes.
He says to himself, “I will not be moved; from age to age I am free of distress.”
His mouth is full of cursing, deceit, and violence; trouble and malice are under his tongue.
He lies in wait near the villages; in ambush he slays the innocent; his eyes watch in stealth for the helpless.
He lies in wait like a lion in a thicket; he lurks to seize the oppressed; he catches the lowly in his net.
They are crushed and beaten down; the hapless fall prey to his strength.
He says to himself, “God has forgotten; He hides His face and never sees.”
Arise, O LORD! Lift up Your hand, O God! Do not forget the helpless.
Why has the wicked man renounced God? He says to himself, “You will never call me to account.”
But You have regarded trouble and grief; You see to repay it by Your hand. The victim entrusts himself to You; You are the helper of the fatherless.
Break the arm of the wicked and evildoer; call him to account for his wickedness until none is left to be found.
The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.
You have heard, O LORD, the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their hearts. You will incline Your ear,
to vindicate the fatherless and oppressed, that the men of the earth may strike terror no more.
