A Psalm of thanksgiving. Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth.
Serve the LORD with gladness; come into His presence with joyful songs.
Know that the LORD is God. It is He who made us, and we are His; we are His people, and the sheep of His pasture.
Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise; give thanks to Him and bless His name.
For the LORD is good, and His loving devotion endures forever; His faithfulness continues to all generations.
