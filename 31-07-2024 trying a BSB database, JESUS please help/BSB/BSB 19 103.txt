Of David. Bless the LORD, O my soul; all that is within me, bless His holy name.
Bless the LORD, O my soul, and do not forget all His kind deeds—
He who forgives all your iniquities and heals all your diseases,
who redeems your life from the Pit and crowns you with loving devotion and compassion,
who satisfies you with good things, so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
The LORD executes righteousness and justice for all the oppressed.
He made known His ways to Moses, His deeds to the people of Israel.
The LORD is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion.
He will not always accuse us, nor harbor His anger forever.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins or repaid us according to our iniquities.
For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His loving devotion for those who fear Him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
As a father has compassion on his children, so the LORD has compassion on those who fear Him.
For He knows our frame; He is mindful that we are dust.
As for man, his days are like grass—he blooms like a flower of the field;
when the wind passes over, it vanishes, and its place remembers it no more.
But from everlasting to everlasting the loving devotion of the LORD extends to those who fear Him, and His righteousness to their children’s children—
to those who keep His covenant and remember to obey His precepts.
The LORD has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all.
Bless the LORD, all His angels mighty in strength who carry out His word, who hearken to the voice of His command.
Bless the LORD, all His hosts, you servants who do His will.
Bless the LORD, all His works in all places of His dominion. Bless the LORD, O my soul!
