A Psalm of David. The LORD said to my Lord: “Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet.”
The LORD extends Your mighty scepter from Zion: “Rule in the midst of Your enemies.”
Your people shall be willing on Your day of battle. Arrayed in holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, to You belongs the dew of Your youth.
The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”
The Lord is at Your right hand; He will crush kings in the day of His wrath.
He will judge the nations, heaping up the dead; He will crush the leaders far and wide.
He will drink from the brook by the road; therefore He will lift up His head.
