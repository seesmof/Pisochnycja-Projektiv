Hallelujah! I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart in the council of the upright and in the assembly.
Great are the works of the LORD; they are pondered by all who delight in them.
Splendid and majestic is His work; His righteousness endures forever.
He has caused His wonders to be remembered; the LORD is gracious and compassionate.
He provides food for those who fear Him; He remembers His covenant forever.
He has shown His people the power of His works by giving them the inheritance of the nations.
The works of His hands are truth and justice; all His precepts are trustworthy.
They are upheld forever and ever, enacted in truth and uprightness.
He has sent redemption to His people; He has ordained His covenant forever; holy and awesome is His name.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom; all who follow His precepts gain rich understanding. His praise endures forever!
