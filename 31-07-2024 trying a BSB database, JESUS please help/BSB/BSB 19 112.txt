Hallelujah! Blessed is the man who fears the LORD, who greatly delights in His commandments.
His descendants will be mighty in the land; the generation of the upright will be blessed.
Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
Light dawns in the darkness for the uprightâ€”for the gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
It is well with the man who is generous and lends freely, whose affairs are guided by justice.
Surely he will never be shaken; the righteous man will be remembered forever.
He does not fear bad news; his heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD.
His heart is assured; he does not fear, until he looks in triumph on his foes.
He has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn will be lifted high in honor.
The wicked man will see and be grieved; he will gnash his teeth and waste away; the desires of the wicked will perish.
