Hallelujah! Give praise, O servants of the LORD; praise the name of the LORD.
Blessed be the name of the LORD both now and forevermore.
From where the sun rises to where it sets, the name of the LORD is praised.
The LORD is exalted over all the nations, His glory above the heavens.
Who is like the LORD our God, the One enthroned on high?
He humbles Himself to behold the heavens and the earth.
He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the dump
to seat them with nobles, with the princes of His people.
He settles the barren woman in her home as a joyful mother to her children. Hallelujah!
