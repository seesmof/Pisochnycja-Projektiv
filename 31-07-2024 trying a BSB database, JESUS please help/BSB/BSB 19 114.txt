When Israel departed from Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of foreign tongue,
Judah became Godâ€™s sanctuary, and Israel His dominion.
The sea observed and fled; the Jordan turned back;
the mountains skipped like rams, the hills like lambs.
Why was it, O sea, that you fled, O Jordan, that you turned back,
O mountains, that you skipped like rams, O hills, like lambs?
Tremble, O earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a fountain of water!
