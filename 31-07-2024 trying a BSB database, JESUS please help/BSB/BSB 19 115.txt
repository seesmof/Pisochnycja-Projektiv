Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to Your name be the glory, because of Your loving devotion, because of Your faithfulness.
Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
Our God is in heaven; He does as He pleases.
Their idols are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
they have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;
they have hands, but cannot feel; they have feet, but cannot walk; they cannot even clear their throats.
Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.
O Israel, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.
You who fear the LORD, trust in the LORD! He is their help and shield.
The LORD is mindful of us; He will bless us. He will bless the house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron;
He will bless those who fear the LORD—small and great alike.
May the LORD give you increase, both you and your children.
May you be blessed by the LORD, the Maker of heaven and earth.
The highest heavens belong to the LORD, but the earth He has given to mankind.
It is not the dead who praise the LORD, nor any who descend into silence.
But it is we who will bless the LORD, both now and forevermore. Hallelujah!
