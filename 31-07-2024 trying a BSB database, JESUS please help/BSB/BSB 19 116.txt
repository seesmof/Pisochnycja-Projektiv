I love the LORD, for He has heard my voice—my appeal for mercy.
Because He has inclined His ear to me, I will call on Him as long as I live.
The ropes of death entangled me; the anguish of Sheol overcame me; I was confronted by trouble and sorrow.
Then I called on the name of the LORD: “O LORD, deliver my soul!”
The LORD is gracious and righteous; our God is full of compassion.
The LORD preserves the simplehearted; I was helpless, and He saved me.
Return to your rest, O my soul, for the LORD has been good to you.
For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, my feet from stumbling.
I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
I believed, therefore I said, “I am greatly afflicted.”
In my alarm I said, “All men are liars!”
How can I repay the LORD for all His goodness to me?
I will lift the cup of salvation and call on the name of the LORD.
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people.
Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of His saints.
Truly, O LORD, I am Your servant; I am Your servant, the son of Your maidservant; You have broken my bonds.
I will offer to You a sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the LORD.
I will fulfill my vows to the LORD in the presence of all His people,
in the courts of the LORD’s house, in your midst, O Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
