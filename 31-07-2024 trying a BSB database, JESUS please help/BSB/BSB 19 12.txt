For the choirmaster. According to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, O LORD, for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.
They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and a double heart.
May the LORD cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue.
They say, “With our tongues we will prevail. We own our lips—who can be our master?”
“For the cause of the oppressed and for the groaning of the needy, I will now arise,” says the LORD. “I will bring safety to him who yearns.”
The words of the LORD are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace, like gold purified sevenfold.
You, O LORD, will keep us; You will forever guard us from this generation.
The wicked wander freely, and vileness is exalted among men.
