A song of ascents. Of David. I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the LORD.”
Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem.
Jerusalem is built up as a city united together,
where the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, as a testimony for Israel, to give thanks to the name of the LORD.
For there the thrones of judgment stand, the thrones of the house of David.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: “May those who love you prosper.
May there be peace within your walls, and prosperity inside your fortresses.”
For the sake of my brothers and friends, I will say, “Peace be within you.”
For the sake of the house of the LORD our God, I will seek your prosperity.
