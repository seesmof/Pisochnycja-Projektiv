A song of ascents. Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion. It cannot be moved; it abides forever.
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds His people, both now and forevermore.
For the scepter of the wicked will not rest upon the land allotted to the righteous, so that the righteous will not put forth their hands to injustice.
Do good, O LORD, to those who are good, and to the upright in heart.
But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be upon Israel.
