A song of ascents. Blessed are all who fear the LORD, who walk in His ways!
For when you eat the fruit of your labor, blessings and prosperity will be yours.
Your wife will be like a fruitful vine flourishing within your house, your sons like olive shoots sitting around your table.
In this way indeed shall blessing come to the man who fears the LORD.
May the LORD bless you from Zion, that you may see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the days of your life,
that you may see your childrenâ€™s children. Peace be upon Israel!
