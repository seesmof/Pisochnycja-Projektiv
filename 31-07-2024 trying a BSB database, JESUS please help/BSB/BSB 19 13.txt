For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me?
How long must I wrestle in my soul, with sorrow in my heart each day? How long will my enemy dominate me?
Consider me and respond, O LORD my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death,
lest my enemy say, “I have overcome him,” and my foes rejoice when I fall.
But I have trusted in Your loving devotion; my heart will rejoice in Your salvation.
I will sing to the LORD, for He has been good to me.
