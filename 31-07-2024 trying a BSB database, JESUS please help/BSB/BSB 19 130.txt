A song of ascents. Out of the depths I cry to You, O LORD!
O Lord, hear my voice; let Your ears be attentive to my plea for mercy.
If You, O LORD, kept track of iniquities, then who, O Lord, could stand?
But with You there is forgiveness, so that You may be feared.
I wait for the LORD; my soul does wait, and in His word I put my hope.
My soul waits for the Lord more than watchmen wait for the morningâ€”more than watchmen wait for the morning.
O Israel, put your hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance.
And He will redeem Israel from all iniquity.
