A song of ascents. O LORD, remember on behalf of David all the hardships he endured,
how he swore an oath to the LORD, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
“I will not enter my house or get into my bed,
I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
until I find a place for the LORD, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
We heard that the ark was in Ephrathah; we found it in the fields of Jaar.
Let us go to His dwelling place; let us worship at His footstool.
Arise, O LORD, to Your resting place, You and the ark of Your strength.
May Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and Your saints shout for joy.
For the sake of Your servant David, do not reject Your anointed one.
The LORD swore an oath to David, a promise He will not revoke: “One of your descendants I will place on your throne.
If your sons keep My covenant and the testimony I will teach them, then their sons will also sit on your throne forever and ever.”
For the LORD has chosen Zion; He has desired it for His home:
“This is My resting place forever and ever; here I will dwell, for I have desired this home.
I will bless her with abundant provisions; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints will sing out in joy.
There I will make a horn grow for David; I have prepared a lamp for My anointed one.
I will clothe his enemies with shame, but the crown upon him will gleam.”
