A song of ascents. Of David. Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in harmony!
It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaronâ€™s beard over the collar of his robes.
It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the LORD has bestowed the blessing of life forevermore.
