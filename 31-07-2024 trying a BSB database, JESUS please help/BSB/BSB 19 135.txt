Hallelujah! Praise the name of the LORD. Give praise, O servants of the LORD,
who stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God.
Hallelujah, for the LORD is good; sing praises to His name, for it is lovely.
For the LORD has chosen Jacob as His own, Israel as His treasured possession.
For I know that the LORD is great; our Lord is above all gods.
The LORD does all that pleases Him in the heavens and on the earth, in the seas and in all their depths.
He causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth. He generates the lightning with the rain and brings forth the wind from His storehouses.
He struck down the firstborn of Egypt, of both man and beast.
He sent signs and wonders into your midst, O Egypt, against Pharaoh and all his servants.
He struck down many nations and slaughtered mighty kings:
Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all the kings of Canaan.
He gave their land as an inheritance, as a heritage to His people Israel.
Your name, O LORD, endures forever, Your renown, O LORD, through all generations.
For the LORD will vindicate His people and will have compassion on His servants.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, made by the hands of men.
They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see;
they have ears, but cannot hear; nor is there breath in their mouths.
Those who make them become like them, as do all who trust in them.
O house of Israel, bless the LORD; O house of Aaron, bless the LORD;
O house of Levi, bless the LORD; you who fear the LORD, bless the LORD!
Blessed be the LORD from Zionâ€”He who dwells in Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
