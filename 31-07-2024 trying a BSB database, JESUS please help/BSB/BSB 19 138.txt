Of David. I give You thanks with all my heart; before the gods I sing Your praises.
I bow down toward Your holy temple and give thanks to Your name for Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness; You have exalted Your name and Your word above all else.
On the day I called, You answered me; You emboldened me and strengthened my soul.
All the kings of the earth will give You thanks, O LORD, when they hear the words of Your mouth.
They will sing of the ways of the LORD, for the glory of the LORD is great.
Though the LORD is on high, He attends to the lowly; but the proud He knows from afar.
If I walk in the midst of trouble, You preserve me from the anger of my foes; You extend Your hand, and Your right hand saves me.
The LORD will fulfill His purpose for me. O LORD, Your loving devotion endures foreverâ€”do not abandon the works of Your hands.
