For the choirmaster. Of David. The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt; their acts are vile. There is no one who does good.
The LORD looks down from heaven upon the sons of men to see if any understand, if any seek God.
All have turned away, they have together become corrupt; there is no one who does good, not even one.
Will the workers of iniquity never learn? They devour my people like bread; they refuse to call upon the LORD.
There they are, overwhelmed with dread, for God is in the company of the righteous.
You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, yet the LORD is their shelter.
Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion! When the LORD restores His captive people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad!
