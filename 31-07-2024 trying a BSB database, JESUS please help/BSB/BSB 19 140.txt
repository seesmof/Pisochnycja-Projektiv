For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. Rescue me, O LORD, from evil men. Protect me from men of violence,
who devise evil in their hearts and stir up war all day long.
They sharpen their tongues like snakes; the venom of vipers is on their lips. Selah
Guard me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked. Keep me safe from men of violence who scheme to make me stumble.
The proud hide a snare for me; the cords of their net are spread along the path, and lures are set out for me. Selah
I say to the LORD, “You are my God.” Hear, O LORD, my cry for help.
O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, You shield my head in the day of battle.
Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked; do not promote their evil plans, lest they be exalted. Selah
May the heads of those who surround me be covered in the trouble their lips have caused.
May burning coals fall on them; may they be thrown into the fire, into the miry pits, never to rise again.
May no slanderer be established in the land; may calamity hunt down the man of violence.
I know that the LORD upholds justice for the poor and defends the cause of the needy.
Surely the righteous will praise Your name; the upright will dwell in Your presence.
