A Psalm of David. I call upon You, O LORD; come quickly to me. Hear my voice when I call to You.
May my prayer be set before You like incense, my uplifted hands like the evening offering.
Set a guard, O LORD, over my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips.
Do not let my heart be drawn to any evil thing or take part in works of wickedness with men who do iniquity; let me not feast on their delicacies.
Let the righteous man strike me; let his rebuke be an act of loving devotion. It is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. For my prayer is ever against the deeds of the wicked.
When their rulers are thrown down from the cliffs, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.
As when one plows and breaks up the soil, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol.
But my eyes are fixed on You, O GOD the Lord. In You I seek refuge; do not leave my soul defenseless.
Keep me from the snares they have laid for me, and from the lures of evildoers.
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by in safety.
