A Psalm of David. O LORD, hear my prayer. In Your faithfulness, give ear to my plea; in Your righteousness, answer me.
Do not bring Your servant into judgment, for no one alive is righteous before You.
For the enemy has pursued my soul, crushing my life to the ground, making me dwell in darkness like those long since dead.
My spirit grows faint within me; my heart is dismayed inside me.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I consider the work of Your hands.
I stretch out my hands to You; my soul thirsts for You like a parched land. Selah
Answer me quickly, O LORD; my spirit fails. Do not hide Your face from me, or I will be like those who descend to the Pit.
Let me hear Your loving devotion in the morning, for I have put my trust in You. Teach me the way I should walk, for to You I lift up my soul.
Deliver me from my enemies, O LORD; I flee to You for refuge.
Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God. May Your good Spirit lead me on level ground.
For the sake of Your name, O LORD, revive me. In Your righteousness, bring my soul out of trouble.
And in Your loving devotion, cut off my enemies. Destroy all who afflict me, for I am Your servant.
