A Psalm of praise. Of David. I will exalt You, my God and King; I will bless Your name forever and ever.
Every day I will bless You, and I will praise Your name forever and ever.
Great is the LORD and greatly to be praised; His greatness is unsearchable.
One generation will commend Your works to the next, and will proclaim Your mighty actsâ€”
the glorious splendor of Your majesty. And I will meditate on Your wondrous works.
They will proclaim the power of Your awesome deeds, and I will declare Your greatness.
They will extol the fame of Your abundant goodness and sing joyfully of Your righteousness.
The LORD is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and abounding in loving devotion.
The LORD is good to all; His compassion rests on all He has made.
All You have made will give You thanks, O LORD, and Your saints will bless You.
They will tell of the glory of Your kingdom and speak of Your might,
to make known to men Your mighty acts and the glorious splendor of Your kingdom.
Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and Your dominion endures through all generations. The LORD is faithful in all His words and kind in all His actions.
The LORD upholds all who fall and lifts up all who are bowed down.
The eyes of all look to You, and You give them their food in season.
You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
The LORD is righteous in all His ways and kind in all His deeds.
The LORD is near to all who call on Him, to all who call out to Him in truth.
He fulfills the desires of those who fear Him; He hears their cry and saves them.
The LORD preserves all who love Him, but all the wicked He will destroy.
My mouth will declare the praise of the LORD; let every creature bless His holy name forever and ever.
