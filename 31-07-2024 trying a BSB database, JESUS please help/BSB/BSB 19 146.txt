Hallelujah! Praise the LORD, O my soul.
I will praise the LORD all my life; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being.
Put not your trust in princes, in mortal man, who cannot save.
When his spirit departs, he returns to the ground; on that very day his plans perish.
Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the LORD his God,
the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He remains faithful forever.
He executes justice for the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The LORD sets the prisoners free,
the LORD opens the eyes of the blind, the LORD lifts those who are weighed down, the LORD loves the righteous.
The LORD protects foreigners; He sustains the fatherless and the widow, but the ways of the wicked He frustrates.
The LORD reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Hallelujah!
