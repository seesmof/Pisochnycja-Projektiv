Hallelujah! How good it is to sing praises to our God, how pleasant and lovely to praise Him!
The LORD builds up Jerusalem; He gathers the exiles of Israel.
He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
He determines the number of the stars; He calls them each by name.
Great is our Lord, and mighty in power; His understanding has no limit.
The LORD sustains the humble, but casts the wicked to the ground.
Sing to the LORD with thanksgiving; make music on the harp to our God,
who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth, who makes grass to grow on the hills.
He provides food for the animals, and for the young ravens when they call.
He does not delight in the strength of the horse; He takes no pleasure in the legpower of the man.
The LORD is pleased with those who fear Him, who hope in His loving devotion.
Exalt the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise your God, O Zion!
For He strengthens the bars of your gates and blesses the children within you.
He makes peace at your borders; He fills you with the finest wheat.
He sends forth His command to the earth; His word runs swiftly.
He spreads the snow like wool; He scatters the frost like ashes;
He casts forth His hail like pebbles. Who can withstand His icy blast?
He sends forth His word and melts them; He unleashes His winds, and the waters flow.
He declares His word to Jacob, His statutes and judgments to Israel.
He has done this for no other nation; they do not know His judgments. Hallelujah!
