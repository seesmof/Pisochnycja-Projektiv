Hallelujah! Praise the LORD from the heavens; praise Him in the highest places.
Praise Him, all His angels; praise Him, all His heavenly hosts.
Praise Him, O sun and moon; praise Him, all you shining stars.
Praise Him, O highest heavens, and you waters above the skies.
Let them praise the name of the LORD, for He gave the command and they were created.
He established them forever and ever; He issued a decree that will never pass away.
Praise the LORD from the earth, all great sea creatures and ocean depths,
lightning and hail, snow and clouds, powerful wind fulfilling His word,
mountains and all hills, fruit trees and all cedars,
wild animals and all cattle, crawling creatures and flying birds,
kings of the earth and all peoples, princes and all rulers of the earth,
young men and maidens, old and young together.
Let them praise the name of the LORD, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens.
He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah!
