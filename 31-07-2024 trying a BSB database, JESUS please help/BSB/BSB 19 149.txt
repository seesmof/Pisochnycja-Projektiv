Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a new songâ€”His praise in the assembly of the godly.
Let Israel rejoice in their Maker; let the children of Zion rejoice in their King.
Let them praise His name with dancing, and make music to Him with tambourine and harp.
For the LORD takes pleasure in His people; He adorns the afflicted with salvation.
Let the saints exult in glory; let them shout for joy upon their beds.
May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a double-edged sword in their hands,
to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment on the peoples,
to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with shackles of iron,
to execute the judgment written against them. This honor is for all His saints. Hallelujah!
