A Psalm of David. O LORD, who may abide in Your tent? Who may dwell on Your holy mountain?
He who walks with integrity and practices righteousness, who speaks the truth from his heart,
who has no slander on his tongue, who does no harm to his neighbor, who casts no scorn on his friend,
who despises the vile but honors those who fear the LORD, who does not revise a costly oath,
who lends his money without interest and refuses a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things will never be shaken.
