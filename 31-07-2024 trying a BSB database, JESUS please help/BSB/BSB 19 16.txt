A Miktam of David. Preserve me, O God, for in You I take refuge.
I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord; apart from You I have no good thing.”
As for the saints in the land, they are the excellence in whom all my delight resides.
Sorrows will multiply to those who chase other gods. I will not pour out their libations of blood, or speak their names with my lips.
The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; You have made my lot secure.
The lines of my boundary have fallen in pleasant places; surely my inheritance is delightful.
I will bless the LORD who counsels me; even at night my conscience instructs me.
I have set the LORD always before me. Because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.
Therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices; my body also will dwell securely.
For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol, nor will You let Your Holy One see decay.
You have made known to me the path of life; You will fill me with joy in Your presence, with eternal pleasures at Your right hand.
