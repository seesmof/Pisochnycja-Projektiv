For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of His hands.
Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge.
Without speech or language, without a sound to be heard,
their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens He has pitched a tent for the sun.
Like a bridegroom emerging from his chamber, like a champion rejoicing to run his course,
it rises at one end of the heavens and runs its circuit to the other; nothing is deprived of its warmth.
The Law of the LORD is perfect, reviving the soul; the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making wise the simple.
The precepts of the LORD are right, bringing joy to the heart; the commandments of the LORD are radiant, giving light to the eyes.
The fear of the LORD is pure, enduring forever; the judgments of the LORD are true, being altogether righteous.
They are more precious than gold, than much pure gold; they are sweeter than honey, than honey from the comb.
By them indeed Your servant is warned; in keeping them is great reward.
Who can discern his own errors? Cleanse me from my hidden faults.
Keep Your servant also from willful sins; may they not rule over me. Then I will be blameless and cleansed of great transgression.
May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in Your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer.
