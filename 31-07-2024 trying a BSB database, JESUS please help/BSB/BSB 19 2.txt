Why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain?
The kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together, against the LORD and against His Anointed One:
“Let us break Their chains and cast away Their cords.”
The One enthroned in heaven laughs; the Lord taunts them.
Then He rebukes them in His anger, and terrifies them in His fury:
“I have installed My King on Zion, upon My holy mountain.”
I will proclaim the decree spoken to Me by the LORD: “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.
Ask Me, and I will make the nations Your inheritance, the ends of the earth Your possession.
You will break them with an iron scepter; You will shatter them like pottery.”
Therefore be wise, O kings; be admonished, O judges of the earth.
Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry and you perish in your rebellion, when His wrath ignites in an instant. Blessed are all who take refuge in Him.
