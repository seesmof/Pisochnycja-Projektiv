For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.
May He send you help from the sanctuary and sustain you from Zion.
May He remember all your gifts and look favorably on your burnt offerings. Selah
May He give you the desires of your heart and make all your plans succeed.
May we shout for joy at your victory and raise a banner in the name of our God. May the LORD grant all your petitions.
Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand.
Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.
They collapse and fall, but we rise up and stand firm.
O LORD, save the king. Answer us on the day we call.
