A Psalm of David. The earth is the LORD’s, and the fullness thereof, the world and all who dwell therein.
For He has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.
Who may ascend the hill of the LORD? Who may stand in His holy place?
He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear deceitfully.
He will receive blessing from the LORD and vindication from the God of his salvation.
Such is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face, O God of Jacob. Selah
Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!
Who is this King of Glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
Lift up your heads, O gates! Be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!
Who is He, this King of Glory? The LORD of Hosts—He is the King of Glory. Selah
