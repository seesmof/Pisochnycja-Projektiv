Of David. To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul;
in You, my God, I trust. Do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.
Surely none who wait for You will be put to shame; but those who are faithless without cause will be disgraced.
Show me Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.
Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You.
Remember, O LORD, Your compassion and loving devotion, for they are from age to age.
Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my rebellious acts; remember me according to Your loving devotion, because of Your goodness, O LORD.
Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He shows sinners the way.
He guides the humble in what is right and teaches them His way.
All the LORDâ€™s ways are loving and faithful to those who keep His covenant and His decrees.
For the sake of Your name, O LORD, forgive my iniquity, for it is great.
Who is the man who fears the LORD? He will instruct him in the path chosen for him.
His soul will dwell in prosperity, and his descendants will inherit the land.
The LORD confides in those who fear Him, and reveals His covenant to them.
My eyes are always on the LORD, for He will free my feet from the mesh.
Turn to me and be gracious, for I am lonely and afflicted.
The troubles of my heart increase; free me from my distress.
Consider my affliction and trouble, and take away all my sins.
Consider my enemies, for they are many, and they hate me with vicious hatred.
Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.
May integrity and uprightness preserve me, because I wait for You.
Redeem Israel, O God, from all its distress.
