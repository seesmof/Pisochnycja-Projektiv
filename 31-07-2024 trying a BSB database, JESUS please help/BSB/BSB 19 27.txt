Of David. The LORD is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life—whom shall I dread?
When the wicked came upon me to devour my flesh, my enemies and foes stumbled and fell.
Though an army encamps around me, my heart will not fear; though a war breaks out against me, I will keep my trust.
One thing I have asked of the LORD; this is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the LORD and seek Him in His temple.
For in the day of trouble He will hide me in His shelter; He will conceal me under the cover of His tent; He will set me high upon a rock.
Then my head will be held high above my enemies around me. At His tabernacle I will offer sacrifices with shouts of joy; I will sing and make music to the LORD.
Hear, O LORD, my voice when I call; be merciful and answer me.
My heart said, “Seek His face.” Your face, O LORD, I will seek.
Hide not Your face from me, nor turn away Your servant in anger. You have been my helper; do not leave me or forsake me, O God of my salvation.
Though my father and mother forsake me, the LORD will receive me.
Teach me Your way, O LORD, and lead me on a level path, because of my oppressors.
Do not hand me over to the will of my foes, for false witnesses rise up against me, breathing out violence.
Still I am certain to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
Wait patiently for the LORD; be strong and courageous. Wait patiently for the LORD!
