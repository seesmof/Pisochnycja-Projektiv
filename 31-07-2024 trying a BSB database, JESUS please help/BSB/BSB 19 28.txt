Of David. To You, O LORD, I call; be not deaf to me, O my Rock. For if You remain silent, I will be like those descending to the Pit.
Hear my cry for mercy when I call to You for help, when I lift up my hands toward Your holy sanctuary.
Do not drag me away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace to their neighbors while malice is in their hearts.
Repay them according to their deeds and for their works of evil. Repay them for what their hands have done; bring back on them what they deserve.
Since they show no regard for the works of the LORD or what His hands have done, He will tear them down and never rebuild them.
Blessed be the LORD, for He has heard my cry for mercy.
The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusts in Him, and I am helped. Therefore my heart rejoices, and I give thanks to Him with my song.
The LORD is the strength of His people, a stronghold of salvation for His anointed.
Save Your people and bless Your inheritance; shepherd them and carry them forever.
