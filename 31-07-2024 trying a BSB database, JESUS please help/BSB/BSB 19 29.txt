A Psalm of David. Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness.
The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders; the LORD is heard over many waters.
The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is majestic.
The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD shatters the cedars of Lebanon.
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox.
The voice of the LORD strikes with flames of fire.
The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the Wilderness of Kadesh.
The voice of the LORD twists the oaks and strips the forests bare. And in His temple all cry, “Glory!”
The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD is enthroned as King forever.
The LORD gives His people strength; the LORD blesses His people with peace.
