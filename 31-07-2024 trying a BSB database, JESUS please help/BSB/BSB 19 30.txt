A Psalm. A song for the dedication of the temple. Of David. I will exalt You, O LORD, for You have lifted me up and have not allowed my foes to rejoice over me.
O LORD my God, I cried to You for help, and You healed me.
O LORD, You pulled me up from Sheol; You spared me from descending into the Pit.
Sing to the LORD, O you His saints, and praise His holy name.
For His anger is fleeting, but His favor lasts a lifetime. Weeping may stay the night, but joy comes in the morning.
In prosperity I said, “I will never be shaken.”
O LORD, You favored me; You made my mountain stand strong. When You hid Your face, I was dismayed.
To You, O LORD, I called, and I begged my Lord for mercy:
“What gain is there in my bloodshed, in my descent to the Pit? Will the dust praise You? Will it proclaim Your faithfulness?
Hear me, O LORD, and have mercy; O LORD, be my helper.”
You turned my mourning into dancing; You peeled off my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,
that my heart may sing Your praises and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks forever.
