Of David. A Maskil. Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man whose iniquity the LORD does not count against him, in whose spirit there is no deceit.
When I kept silent, my bones became brittle from my groaning all day long.
For day and night Your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was drained as in the summer heat. Selah
Then I acknowledged my sin to You and did not hide my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD,” and You forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah
Therefore let all the godly pray to You while You may be found. Surely when great waters rise, they will not come near.
You are my hiding place. You protect me from trouble; You surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah
I will instruct you and teach you the way you should go; I will give you counsel and watch over you.
Do not be like the horse or mule, which have no understanding; they must be controlled with bit and bridle to make them come to you.
Many are the sorrows of the wicked, but loving devotion surrounds him who trusts in the LORD.
Be glad in the LORD and rejoice, O righteous ones; shout for joy, all you upright in heart.
