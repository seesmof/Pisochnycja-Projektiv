Rejoice in the LORD, O righteous ones; it is fitting for the upright to praise Him.
Praise the LORD with the harp; make music to Him with ten strings.
Sing to Him a new song; play skillfully with a shout of joy.
For the word of the LORD is upright, and all His work is trustworthy.
The LORD loves righteousness and justice; the earth is full of His loving devotion.
By the word of the LORD the heavens were made, and all the stars by the breath of His mouth.
He piles up the waters of the sea; He puts the depths into storehouses.
Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the people of the world revere Him.
For He spoke, and it came to be; He commanded, and it stood firm.
The LORD frustrates the plans of the nations; He thwarts the devices of the peoples.
The counsel of the LORD stands forever, the purposes of His heart to all generations.
Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD, the people He has chosen as His inheritance!
The LORD looks down from heaven; He sees all the sons of men.
From His dwelling place He gazes on all who inhabit the earth.
He shapes the hearts of each; He considers all their works.
No king is saved by his vast army; no warrior is delivered by his great strength.
A horse is a vain hope for salvation; even its great strength cannot save.
Surely the eyes of the LORD are on those who fear Him, on those whose hope is in His loving devotion
to deliver them from death and keep them alive in famine.
Our soul waits for the LORD; He is our help and our shield.
For our hearts rejoice in Him, since we trust in His holy name.
May Your loving devotion rest on us, O LORD, as we put our hope in You.
