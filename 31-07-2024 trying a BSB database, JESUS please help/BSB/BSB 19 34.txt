Of David, when he pretended to be insane before Abimelech, so that the king drove him away. I will bless the LORD at all times; His praise will always be on my lips.
My soul boasts in the LORD; let the oppressed hear and rejoice.
Magnify the LORD with me; let us exalt His name together.
I sought the LORD, and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears.
Those who look to Him are radiant with joy; their faces shall never be ashamed.
This poor man called out, and the LORD heard him; He saved him from all his troubles.
The angel of the LORD encamps around those who fear Him, and he delivers them.
Taste and see that the LORD is good; blessed is the man who takes refuge in Him!
Fear the LORD, you His saints, for those who fear Him lack nothing.
Young lions go lacking and hungry, but those who seek the LORD lack no good thing.
Come, children, listen to me; I will teach you the fear of the LORD.
Who is the man who delights in life, who desires to see good days?
Keep your tongue from evil and your lips from deceitful speech.
Turn away from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
The eyes of the LORD are on the righteous, and His ears are inclined to their cry.
But the face of the LORD is against those who do evil, to wipe out all memory of them from the earth.
The righteous cry out, and the LORD hears; He delivers them from all their troubles.
The LORD is near to the brokenhearted; He saves the contrite in spirit.
Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the LORD delivers him from them all.
He protects all his bones; not one of them will be broken.
Evil will slay the wicked, and the haters of the righteous will be condemned.
The LORD redeems His servants, and none who take refuge in Him will be condemned.
