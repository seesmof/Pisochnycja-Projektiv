For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, the servant of the LORD. An oracle is in my heart regarding the transgression of the wicked man: There is no fear of God before his eyes.
For his eyes are too full of conceit to detect or hate his own sin.
The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; he has ceased to be wise and well-doing.
Even on his bed he plots wickedness; he sets himself on a path that is not good; he fails to reject evil.
Your loving devotion, O LORD, reaches to the heavens, Your faithfulness to the clouds.
Your righteousness is like the highest mountains; Your judgments are like the deepest sea. O LORD, You preserve man and beast.
How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings!
They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights.
For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light.
Extend Your loving devotion to those who know You, and Your righteousness to the upright in heart.
Let not the foot of the proud come against me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.
There the evildoers lie fallen, thrown down and unable to rise.
