For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have relieved my distress; show me grace and hear my prayer.
How long, O men, will my honor be maligned? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies? Selah
Know that the LORD has set apart the godly for Himself; the LORD hears when I call to Him.
Be angry, yet do not sin; on your bed, search your heart and be still. Selah
Offer the sacrifices of the righteous and trust in the LORD.
Many ask, “Who can show us the good?” Shine the light of Your face upon us, O LORD.
You have filled my heart with more joy than when grain and new wine abound.
I will lie down and sleep in peace, for You alone, O LORD, make me dwell in safety.
