For the choirmaster. Of the sons of Korah. According to Alamoth. A song. God is our refuge and strength, an ever-present help in times of trouble.
Therefore we will not fear, though the earth is transformed and the mountains are toppled into the depths of the seas,
though their waters roar and foam and the mountains quake in the surge. Selah
There is a river whose streams delight the city of God, the holy place where the Most High dwells.
God is within her; she will not be moved. God will help her when morning dawns.
Nations rage, kingdoms crumble; the earth melts when He lifts His voice.
The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
Come, see the works of the LORD, who brings devastation upon the earth.
He makes wars to cease throughout the earth; He breaks the bow and shatters the spear; He burns the shields in the fire.
“Be still and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted over the earth.”
The LORD of Hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our fortress. Selah
