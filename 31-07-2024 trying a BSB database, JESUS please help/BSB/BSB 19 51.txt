For the choirmaster. A Psalm of David. When Nathan the prophet came to him after his adultery with Bathsheba. Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving devotion; according to Your great compassion, blot out my transgressions.
Wash me clean of my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.
Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You may be proved right when You speak and blameless when You judge.
Surely I was brought forth in iniquity; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
Surely You desire truth in the inmost being; You teach me wisdom in the inmost place.
Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones You have crushed rejoice.
Hide Your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from Your presence; take not Your Holy Spirit from me.
Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.
Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners will return to You.
Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, the God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing of Your righteousness.
O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.
For You do not delight in sacrifice, or I would bring it; You take no pleasure in burnt offerings.
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.
In Your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper; build up the walls of Jerusalem.
Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.
