For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Maskil of David. Listen to my prayer, O God, and do not ignore my plea.
Attend to me and answer me. I am restless in my complaint, and distraught
at the voice of the enemy, at the pressure of the wicked. For they release disaster upon me and revile me in their anger.
My heart murmurs within me, and the terrors of death assail me.
Fear and trembling grip me, and horror has overwhelmed me.
I said, “Oh, that I had wings like a dove! I would fly away and find rest.
How far away I would flee! In the wilderness I would remain. Selah
I would hurry to my shelter, far from this raging tempest.”
O Lord, confuse and confound their speech, for I see violence and strife in the city.
Day and night they encircle the walls, while malice and trouble lie within.
Destruction is within; oppression and deceit never leave the streets.
For it is not an enemy who insults me; that I could endure. It is not a foe who rises against me; from him I could hide.
But it is you, a man like myself, my companion and close friend.
We shared sweet fellowship together; we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
Let death seize them by surprise; let them go down to Sheol alive, for evil is with them in their homes.
But I call to God, and the LORD saves me.
Morning, noon, and night, I cry out in distress, and He hears my voice.
He redeems my soul in peace from the battle waged against me, even though many oppose me.
God will hear and humiliate them—the One enthroned for the ages—Selah because they do not change and they have no fear of God.
My companion attacks his friends; he violates his covenant.
His speech is smooth as butter, but war is in his heart. His words are softer than oil, yet they are swords unsheathed.
Cast your burden upon the LORD and He will sustain you; He will never let the righteous be shaken.
But You, O God, will bring them down to the Pit of destruction; men of bloodshed and deceit will not live out half their days. But I will trust in You.
