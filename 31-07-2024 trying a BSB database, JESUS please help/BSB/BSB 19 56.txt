For the choirmaster. To the tune of “A Dove on Distant Oaks.” A Miktam of David, when the Philistines seized him in Gath. Be merciful to me, O God, for men are hounding me; all day they press their attack.
My enemies pursue me all day long, for many proudly assail me.
When I am afraid, I put my trust in You.
In God, whose word I praise—in God I trust. I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
All day long they twist my words; all their thoughts are on my demise.
They conspire, they lurk, they watch my steps while they wait to take my life.
In spite of such sin, will they escape? In Your anger, O God, cast down the nations.
You have taken account of my wanderings. Put my tears in Your bottle—are they not in Your book?
Then my enemies will retreat on the day I cry for help. By this I will know that God is on my side.
In God, whose word I praise, in the LORD, whose word I praise,
in God I trust; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me?
Your vows are upon me, O God; I will render thank offerings to You.
For You have delivered my soul from death, and my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of life.
