For the choirmaster. To the tune of “Do Not Destroy.” A Miktam of David, when Saul sent men to watch David’s house in order to kill him. Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; protect me from those who rise against me.
Deliver me from workers of iniquity, and save me from men of bloodshed.
See how they lie in wait for me. Fierce men conspire against me for no transgression or sin of my own, O LORD.
For no fault of my own, they move swiftly to attack me. Arise to help me, and take notice.
O LORD God of Hosts, the God of Israel, rouse Yourself to punish all the nations; show no mercy to the wicked traitors. Selah
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
See what they spew from their mouths—sharp words from their lips: “For who can hear us?”
But You, O LORD, laugh at them; You scoff at all the nations.
I will keep watch for You, O my strength, because You, O God, are my fortress.
My God of loving devotion will come to meet me; God will let me stare down my foes.
Do not kill them, or my people will forget. Scatter them by Your power, and bring them down, O Lord, our shield.
By the sins of their mouths and the words of their lips, let them be trapped in their pride, in the curses and lies they utter.
Consume them in wrath; consume them till they are no more, so it may be known to the ends of the earth that God rules over Jacob. Selah
They return in the evening, snarling like dogs and prowling around the city.
They scavenge for food, and growl if they are not satisfied.
But I will sing of Your strength and proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning. For You are my fortress, my refuge in times of trouble.
To You, O my strength, I sing praises, for You, O God, are my fortress, my God of loving devotion.
