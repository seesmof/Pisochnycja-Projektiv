For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments, according to Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger or discipline me in Your wrath.
Be merciful to me, O LORD, for I am frail; heal me, O LORD, for my bones are in agony.
My soul is deeply distressed. How long, O LORD, how long?
Turn, O LORD, and deliver my soul; save me because of Your loving devotion.
For there is no mention of You in death; who can praise You from Sheol?
I am weary from groaning; all night I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
My eyes fail from grief; they grow dim because of all my foes.
Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity, for the LORD has heard my weeping.
The LORD has heard my cry for mercy; the LORD accepts my prayer.
All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.
