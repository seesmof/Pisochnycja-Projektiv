For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lily of the Covenant.” A Miktam of David for instruction. When he fought Aram-naharaim and Aram-zobah, and Joab returned and struck down 12,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. You have rejected us, O God; You have broken us; You have been angry; restore us!
You have shaken the land and torn it open. Heal its fractures, for it is quaking.
You have shown Your people hardship; we are staggered from the wine You made us drink.
You have raised a banner for those who fear You, that they may flee the bow. Selah
Respond and save us with Your right hand, that Your beloved may be delivered.
God has spoken from His sanctuary: “I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem and apportion the Valley of Succoth.
Gilead is Mine, and Manasseh is Mine; Ephraim is My helmet, Judah is My scepter.
Moab is My washbasin; upon Edom I toss My sandal; over Philistia I shout in triumph.”
Who will bring me to the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom?
Have You not rejected us, O God? Will You no longer march out, O God, with our armies?
Give us aid against the enemy, for the help of man is worthless.
With God we will perform with valor, and He will trample our enemies.
