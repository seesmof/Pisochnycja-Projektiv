For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. Of David. Hear my cry, O God; attend to my prayer.
From the ends of the earth I call out to You whenever my heart is faint. Lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
For You have been my refuge, a tower of strength against the enemy.
Let me dwell in Your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of Your wings. Selah
For You have heard my vows, O God; You have given me the inheritance reserved for those who fear Your name.
Increase the days of the king’s life; may his years span many generations.
May he sit enthroned in God’s presence forever; appoint Your loving devotion and Your faithfulness to guard him.
Then I will ever sing praise to Your name and fulfill my vows day by day.
