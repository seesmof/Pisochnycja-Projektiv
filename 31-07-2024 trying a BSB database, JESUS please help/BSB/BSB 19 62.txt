For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of David. In God alone my soul finds rest; my salvation comes from Him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation. He is my fortress; I will never be shaken.
How long will you threaten a man? Will all of you throw him down like a leaning wall or a tottering fence?
They fully intend to cast him down from his lofty perch; they delight in lies; with their mouths they bless, but inwardly they curse. Selah
Rest in God alone, O my soul, for my hope comes from Him.
He alone is my rock and my salvation; He is my fortress; I will not be shaken.
My salvation and my honor rest on God, my strong rock; my refuge is in God.
Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts before Him. God is our refuge. Selah
Lowborn men are but a vapor, the exalted but a lie. Weighed on the scale, they go up; together they are but a vapor.
Place no trust in extortion, or false hope in stolen goods. If your riches increase, do not set your heart upon them.
God has spoken once; I have heard this twice: that power belongs to God,
and loving devotion to You, O Lord. For You will repay each man according to his deeds.
