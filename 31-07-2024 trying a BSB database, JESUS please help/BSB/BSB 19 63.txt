A Psalm of David, when he was in the Wilderness of Judah. O God, You are my God. Earnestly I seek You; my soul thirsts for You. My body yearns for You in a dry and weary land without water.
So I have seen You in the sanctuary and beheld Your power and glory.
Because Your loving devotion is better than life, my lips will glorify You.
So I will bless You as long as I live; in Your name I will lift my hands.
My soul is satisfied as with the richest of foods; with joyful lips my mouth will praise You.
When I remember You on my bed, I think of You through the watches of the night.
For You are my help; I will sing for joy in the shadow of Your wings.
My soul clings to You; Your right hand upholds me.
But those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth.
They will fall to the power of the sword; they will become a portion for foxes.
But the king will rejoice in God; all who swear by Him will exult, for the mouths of liars will be shut.
