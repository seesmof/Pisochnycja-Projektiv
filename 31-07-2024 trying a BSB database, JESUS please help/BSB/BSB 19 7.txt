A Shiggaion of David, which he sang to the LORD concerning the words of Cush, a Benjamite. O LORD my God, I take refuge in You; save me and deliver me from all my pursuers,
or they will shred my soul like a lion and tear me to pieces with no one to rescue me.
O LORD my God, if I have done this, if injustice is on my hands,
if I have rewarded my ally with evil, if I have plundered my foe without cause,
then may my enemy pursue me and overtake me; may he trample me to the ground and leave my honor in the dust. Selah
Arise, O LORD, in Your anger; rise up against the fury of my enemies. Awake, my God, and ordain judgment.
Let the assembled peoples gather around You; take Your seat over them on high.
The LORD judges the peoples; vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity.
Put an end to the evil of the wicked, but establish the righteous, O righteous God who searches hearts and minds.
My shield is with God, who saves the upright in heart.
God is a righteous judge and a God who feels indignation each day.
If one does not repent, God will sharpen His sword; He has bent and strung His bow.
He has prepared His deadly weapons; He ordains His arrows with fire.
Behold, the wicked man travails with evil; he conceives trouble and births falsehood.
He has dug a hole and hollowed it out; he has fallen into a pit of his own making.
His trouble recoils on himself, and his violence falls on his own head.
I will thank the LORD for His righteousness and sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.
