For the choirmaster. Of David. To bring remembrance. Make haste, O God, to deliver me! Hurry, O LORD, to help me!
May those who seek my life be ashamed and confounded; may those who wish me harm be repelled and humiliated.
May those who say, “Aha, aha!” retreat because of their shame.
May all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; may those who love Your salvation always say, “Let God be magnified!”
But I am poor and needy; hurry to me, O God. You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
