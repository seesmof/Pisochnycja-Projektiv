Of Solomon. Endow the king with Your justice, O God, and the son of the king with Your righteousness.
May he judge Your people with righteousness and Your afflicted with justice.
May the mountains bring peace to the people, and the hills bring righteousness.
May he vindicate the afflicted among the people; may he save the children of the needy and crush the oppressor.
May they fear him as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon remains, through all generations.
May he be like rain that falls on freshly cut grass, like spring showers that water the earth.
May the righteous flourish in his days and prosperity abound, until the moon is no more.
May he rule from sea to sea, and from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth.
May the nomads bow before him, and his enemies lick the dust.
May the kings of Tarshish and distant shores bring tribute; may the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
May all kings bow down to him and all nations serve him.
For he will deliver the needy who cry out and the afflicted who have no helper.
He will take pity on the poor and needy and save the lives of the oppressed.
He will redeem them from oppression and violence, for their blood is precious in his sight.
Long may he live! May gold from Sheba be given him. May people ever pray for him; may they bless him all day long.
May there be an abundance of grain in the land; may it sway atop the hills. May its fruit trees flourish like the forests of Lebanon, and its people like the grass of the field.
May his name endure forever; may his name continue as long as the sun shines. In him may all nations be blessed; may they call him blessed.
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who alone does marvelous deeds.
And blessed be His glorious name forever; may all the earth be filled with His glory. Amen and amen.
Thus conclude the prayers of David son of Jesse.
