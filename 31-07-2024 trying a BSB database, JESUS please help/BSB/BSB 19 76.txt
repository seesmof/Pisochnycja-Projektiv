For the choirmaster. With stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph. A song. God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel.
His tent is in Salem, His dwelling place in Zion.
There He shattered the flaming arrows, the shield and sword and weapons of war. Selah
You are resplendent with light, more majestic than mountains filled with game.
The valiant lie plundered; they sleep their last sleep. No men of might could lift a hand.
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, both horse and rider lie stunned.
You alone are to be feared. When You are angry, who can stand before You?
From heaven You pronounced judgment, and the earth feared and was still
when God rose up to judge, to save all the lowly of the earth. Selah
Even the wrath of man shall praise You; with the survivors of wrath You will clothe Yourself.
Make and fulfill your vows to the LORD your God; let all the neighboring lands bring tribute to Him who is to be feared.
He breaks the spirits of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
