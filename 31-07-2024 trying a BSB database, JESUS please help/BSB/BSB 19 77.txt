For the choirmaster. According to Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to God; I cried aloud to God to hear me.
In the day of trouble I sought the Lord; through the night my outstretched hands did not grow weary; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered You, O God, and I groaned; I mused and my spirit grew faint. Selah
You have kept my eyes from closing; I am too troubled to speak.
I considered the days of old, the years long in the past.
At night I remembered my song; in my heart I mused, and my spirit pondered:
“Will the Lord spurn us forever and never show His favor again?
Is His loving devotion gone forever? Has His promise failed for all time?
Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has His anger shut off His compassion?” Selah
So I said, “I am grieved that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
I will remember the works of the LORD; yes, I will remember Your wonders of old.
I will reflect on all You have done and ponder Your mighty deeds.
Your way, O God, is holy. What god is so great as our God?
You are the God who works wonders; You display Your strength among the peoples.
With power You redeemed Your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah
The waters saw You, O God; the waters saw You and swirled; even the depths were shaken.
The clouds poured down water; the skies resounded with thunder; Your arrows flashed back and forth.
Your thunder resounded in the whirlwind; the lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and quaked.
Your path led through the sea, Your way through the mighty waters, but Your footprints were not to be found.
You led Your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
