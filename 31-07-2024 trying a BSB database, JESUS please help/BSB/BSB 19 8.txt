For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. A Psalm of David. O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth! You have set Your glory above the heavens.
From the mouths of children and infants You have ordained praise on account of Your adversaries, to silence the enemy and avenger.
When I behold Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have set in placeâ€”
what is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You care for him?
You made him a little lower than the angels; You crowned him with glory and honor.
You made him ruler of the works of Your hands; You have placed everything under his feet:
all sheep and oxen, and even the beasts of the field,
the birds of the air and the fish of the sea, all that swim the paths of the seas.
O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is Your name in all the earth!
