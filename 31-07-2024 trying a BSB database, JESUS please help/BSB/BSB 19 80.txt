For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Lilies of the Covenant.” A Psalm of Asaph. Hear us, O Shepherd of Israel, who leads Joseph like a flock; You who sit enthroned between the cherubim, shine forth
before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Rally Your mighty power and come to save us.
Restore us, O God, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
O LORD God of Hosts, how long will Your anger smolder against the prayers of Your people?
You fed them with the bread of tears and made them drink the full measure of their tears.
You make us contend with our neighbors; our enemies mock us.
Restore us, O God of Hosts, and cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
You uprooted a vine from Egypt; You drove out the nations and transplanted it.
You cleared the ground for it, and it took root and filled the land.
The mountains were covered by its shade, and the mighty cedars with its branches.
It sent out its branches to the Sea, and its shoots toward the River.
Why have You broken down its walls, so that all who pass by pick its fruit?
The boar from the forest ravages it, and the creatures of the field feed upon it.
Return, O God of Hosts, we pray! Look down from heaven and see! Attend to this vine—
the root Your right hand has planted, the son You have raised up for Yourself.
Your vine has been cut down and burned; they perish at the rebuke of Your countenance.
Let Your hand be upon the man at Your right hand, on the son of man You have raised up for Yourself.
Then we will not turn away from You; revive us, and we will call on Your name.
Restore us, O LORD God of Hosts; cause Your face to shine upon us, that we may be saved.
