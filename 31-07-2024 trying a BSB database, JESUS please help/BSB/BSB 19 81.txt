For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. Of Asaph. Sing for joy to God our strength; make a joyful noise to the God of Jacob.
Lift up a song, strike the tambourine, play the sweet-sounding harp and lyre.
Sound the ram’s horn at the New Moon, and at the full moon on the day of our Feast.
For this is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
He ordained it as a testimony for Joseph when he went out over the land of Egypt, where I heard an unfamiliar language:
“I relieved his shoulder of the burden; his hands were freed from the basket.
You called out in distress, and I rescued you; I answered you from the cloud of thunder; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Selah
Hear, O My people, and I will warn you: O Israel, if only you would listen to Me!
There must be no strange god among you, nor shall you bow to a foreign god.
I am the LORD your God, who brought you up out of Egypt. Open wide your mouth, and I will fill it.
But My people would not listen to Me, and Israel would not obey Me.
So I gave them up to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices.
If only My people would listen to Me, if Israel would follow My ways,
how soon I would subdue their enemies and turn My hand against their foes!
Those who hate the LORD would feign obedience, and their doom would last forever.
But I would feed you the finest wheat; with honey from the rock I would satisfy you.”
