A song. A Psalm of Asaph. O God, be not silent; be not speechless; be not still, O God.
See how Your enemies rage, how Your foes have reared their heads.
With cunning they scheme against Your people and conspire against those You cherish,
saying, “Come, let us erase them as a nation; may the name of Israel be remembered no more.”
For with one mind they plot together, they form an alliance against You—
the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites, of Moab and the Hagrites,
of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, of Philistia with the people of Tyre.
Even Assyria has joined them, lending strength to the sons of Lot. Selah
Do to them as You did to Midian, as to Sisera and Jabin at the River Kishon,
who perished at Endor and became like dung on the ground.
Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb, and all their princes like Zebah and Zalmunna,
who said, “Let us possess for ourselves the pastures of God.”
Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like chaff before the wind.
As fire consumes a forest, as a flame sets the mountains ablaze,
so pursue them with Your tempest, and terrify them with Your storm.
Cover their faces with shame, that they may seek Your name, O LORD.
May they be ever ashamed and terrified; may they perish in disgrace.
May they know that You alone, whose name is the LORD, are Most High over all the earth.
