For the choirmaster. According to Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How lovely is Your dwelling place, O LORD of Hosts!
My soul longs, even faints, for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
Even the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she places her young near Your altars, O LORD of Hosts, my King and my God.
How blessed are those who dwell in Your house! They are ever praising You. Selah
Blessed are those whose strength is in You, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a place of springs; even the autumn rain covers it with pools.
They go from strength to strength, until each appears before God in Zion.
O LORD God of Hosts, hear my prayer; give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah
Take notice of our shield, O God, and look with favor on the face of Your anointed.
For better is one day in Your courts than a thousand elsewhere. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the tents of the wicked.
For the LORD God is a sun and a shield; the LORD gives grace and glory; He withholds no good thing from those who walk with integrity.
O LORD of Hosts, how blessed is the man who trusts in You!
