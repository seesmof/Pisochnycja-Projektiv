For the choirmaster. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. You showed favor to Your land, O LORD; You restored Jacob from captivity.
You forgave the iniquity of Your people; You covered all their sin. Selah
You withheld all Your fury; You turned from Your burning anger.
Restore us, O God of our salvation, and put away Your displeasure toward us.
Will You be angry with us forever? Will You draw out Your anger to all generations?
Will You not revive us again, that Your people may rejoice in You?
Show us Your loving devotion, O LORD, and grant us Your salvation.
I will listen to what God the LORD will say; for He will surely speak peace to His people and His saints; He will not let them return to folly.
Surely His salvation is near to those who fear Him, that His glory may dwell in our land.
Loving devotion and faithfulness have joined together; righteousness and peace have kissed.
Faithfulness sprouts from the earth, and righteousness looks down from heaven.
The LORD will indeed provide what is good, and our land will yield its increase.
Righteousness will go before Him to prepare the way for His steps.
