A prayer of David. Incline Your ear, O LORD, and answer me, for I am poor and needy.
Preserve my soul, for I am godly. You are my God; save Your servant who trusts in You.
Be merciful to me, O Lord, for I call to You all day long.
Bring joy to Your servant, for to You, O Lord, I lift up my soul.
For You, O Lord, are kind and forgiving, rich in loving devotion to all who call on You.
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and attend to my plea for mercy.
In the day of my distress I call on You, because You answer me.
O Lord, there is none like You among the gods, nor any works like Yours.
All the nations You have made will come and bow before You, O Lord, and they will glorify Your name.
For You are great and perform wonders; You alone are God.
Teach me Your way, O LORD, that I may walk in Your truth. Give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your name.
I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever.
For great is Your loving devotion to me; You have delivered me from the depths of Sheol.
The arrogant rise against me, O God; a band of ruthless men seeks my life, with no regard for You.
But You, O Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in loving devotion and faithfulness.
Turn to me and have mercy; grant Your strength to Your servant; save the son of Your maidservant.
Show me a sign of Your goodness, that my enemies may see and be ashamed; for You, O LORD, have helped me and comforted me.
