For the choirmaster. To the tune of “The Death of the Son.” A Psalm of David. I will give thanks to the LORD with all my heart; I will recount all Your wonders.
I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.
When my enemies retreat, they stumble and perish before You.
For You have upheld my just cause; You sit on Your throne judging righteously.
You have rebuked the nations; You have destroyed the wicked; You have erased their name forever and ever.
The enemy has come to eternal ruin, and You have uprooted their cities; the very memory of them has vanished.
But the LORD abides forever; He has established His throne for judgment.
He judges the world with justice; He governs the people with equity.
The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble.
Those who know Your name trust in You, for You, O LORD, have not forsaken those who seek You.
Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion; proclaim His deeds among the nations.
For the Avenger of bloodshed remembers; He does not ignore the cry of the afflicted.
Be merciful to me, O LORD; see how my enemies afflict me! Lift me up from the gates of death,
that I may declare all Your praises—that within the gates of Daughter Zion I may rejoice in Your salvation.
The nations have fallen into a pit of their making; their feet are caught in the net they have hidden.
The LORD is known by the justice He brings; the wicked are ensnared by the work of their hands. Higgaion Selah
The wicked will return to Sheol—all the nations who forget God.
For the needy will not always be forgotten; nor the hope of the oppressed forever dashed.
Rise up, O LORD, do not let man prevail; let the nations be judged in Your presence.
Lay terror upon them, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah
