A Psalm. A song for the Sabbath day. It is good to praise the LORD, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High,
to proclaim Your loving devotion in the morning and Your faithfulness at night
with the ten-stringed harp and the melody of the lyre.
For You, O LORD, have made me glad by Your deeds; I sing for joy at the works of Your hands.
How great are Your works, O LORD, how deep are Your thoughts!
A senseless man does not know, and a fool does not understand,
that though the wicked sprout like grass, and all evildoers flourish, they will be forever destroyed.
But You, O LORD, are exalted forever!
For surely Your enemies, O LORD, surely Your enemies will perish; all evildoers will be scattered.
But You have exalted my horn like that of a wild ox; with fine oil I have been anointed.
My eyes see the downfall of my enemies; my ears hear the wailing of my wicked foes.
The righteous will flourish like a palm tree, and grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
Planted in the house of the LORD, they will flourish in the courts of our God.
In old age they will still bear fruit; healthy and green they will remain,
to proclaim, “The LORD is upright; He is my Rock, and in Him there is no unrighteousness.”
