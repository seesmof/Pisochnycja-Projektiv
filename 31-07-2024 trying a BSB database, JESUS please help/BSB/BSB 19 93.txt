The LORD reigns! He is robed in majesty; the LORD has clothed and armed Himself with strength. The world indeed is firmly established; it cannot be moved.
Your throne was established long ago; You are from all eternity.
The floodwaters have risen, O LORD; the rivers have raised their voice; the seas lift up their pounding waves.
Above the roar of many waters—the mighty breakers of the sea—the LORD on high is majestic.
Your testimonies are fully confirmed; holiness adorns Your house, O LORD, for all the days to come.
