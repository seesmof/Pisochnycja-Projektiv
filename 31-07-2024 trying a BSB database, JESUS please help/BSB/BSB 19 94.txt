O LORD, God of vengeance, O God of vengeance, shine forth.
Rise up, O Judge of the earth; render a reward to the proud.
How long will the wicked, O LORD, how long will the wicked exult?
They pour out arrogant words; all workers of iniquity boast.
They crush Your people, O LORD; they oppress Your heritage.
They kill the widow and the foreigner; they murder the fatherless.
They say, “The LORD does not see; the God of Jacob pays no heed.”
Take notice, O senseless among the people! O fools, when will you be wise?
He who affixed the ear, can He not hear? He who formed the eye, can He not see?
He who admonishes the nations, does He not discipline? He who teaches man, does He lack knowledge?
The LORD knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
Blessed is the man You discipline, O LORD, and teach from Your law,
to grant him relief from days of trouble, until a pit is dug for the wicked.
For the LORD will not forsake His people; He will never abandon His heritage.
Surely judgment will again be righteous, and all the upright in heart will follow it.
Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against the workers of iniquity?
Unless the LORD had been my helper, I would soon have dwelt in the abode of silence.
If I say, “My foot is slipping,” Your loving devotion, O LORD, supports me.
When anxiety overwhelms me, Your consolation delights my soul.
Can a corrupt throne be Your ally—one devising mischief by decree?
They band together against the righteous and condemn the innocent to death.
But the LORD has been my stronghold, and my God is my rock of refuge.
He will bring upon them their own iniquity and destroy them for their wickedness. The LORD our God will destroy them.
