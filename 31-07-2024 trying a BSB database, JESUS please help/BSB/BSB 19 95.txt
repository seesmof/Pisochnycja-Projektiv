Come, let us sing for joy to the LORD; let us shout to the Rock of our salvation!
Let us enter His presence with thanksgiving; let us make a joyful noise to Him in song.
For the LORD is a great God, a great King above all gods.
In His hand are the depths of the earth, and the mountain peaks belong to Him.
The sea is His, for He made it, and His hands formed the dry land.
O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the LORD our Maker.
For He is our God, and we are the people of His pasture, the sheep under His care. Today, if you hear His voice,
do not harden your hearts as you did at Meribah, in the day at Massah in the wilderness,
where your fathers tested and tried Me, though they had seen My work.
For forty years I was angry with that generation, and I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray, and they have not known My ways.”
So I swore on oath in My anger, “They shall never enter My rest.”
