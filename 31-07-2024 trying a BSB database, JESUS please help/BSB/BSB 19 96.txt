Sing to the LORD a new song; sing to the LORD, all the earth.
Sing to the LORD, bless His name; proclaim His salvation day after day.
Declare His glory among the nations, His wonderful deeds among all peoples.
For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods.
For all the gods of the nations are idols, but it is the LORD who made the heavens.
Splendor and majesty are before Him; strength and beauty fill His sanctuary.
Ascribe to the LORD, O families of the nations, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength.
Ascribe to the LORD the glory due His name; bring an offering and enter His courts.
Worship the LORD in the splendor of His holiness; tremble before Him, all the earth.
Declare among the nations: “The LORD reigns!” The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved; He will judge the peoples with equity.
Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice; let the sea resound, and all that fills it.
Let the fields exult, and all that is in them. Then all the trees of the forest will sing for joy
before the LORD, for He is coming—He is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world in righteousness and the peoples in His faithfulness.
