The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the distant shores be glad.
Clouds and darkness surround Him; righteousness and justice are His throne’s foundation.
Fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side.
His lightning illuminates the world; the earth sees and trembles.
The mountains melt like wax at the presence of the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth.
The heavens proclaim His righteousness; all the peoples see His glory.
All worshipers of images are put to shame—those who boast in idols. Worship Him, all you gods!
Zion hears and rejoices, and the towns of Judah exult because of Your judgments, O LORD.
For You, O LORD, are Most High over all the earth; You are exalted far above all gods.
Hate evil, O you who love the LORD! He preserves the souls of His saints; He delivers them from the hand of the wicked.
Light shines on the righteous, gladness on the upright in heart.
Rejoice in the LORD, you righteous ones, and praise His holy name.
