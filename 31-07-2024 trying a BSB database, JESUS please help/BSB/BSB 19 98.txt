A Psalm. Sing to the LORD a new song, for He has done wonders; His right hand and holy arm have gained Him the victory.
The LORD has proclaimed His salvation and revealed His righteousness to the nations.
He has remembered His love and faithfulness to the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
Make a joyful noise to the LORD, all the earth; break forth—let your cry ring out, and sing praises!
Sing praises to the LORD with the lyre, in melodious song with the harp.
With trumpets and the blast of the ram’s horn shout for joy before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea resound, and all that fills it, the world, and all who dwell in it.
Let the rivers clap their hands, let the mountains sing together for joy
before the LORD, for He comes to judge the earth. He will judge the world with righteousness and the peoples with equity.
