The LORD reigns; let the nations tremble! He is enthroned above the cherubim; let the earth quake!
Great is the LORD in Zion; He is exalted above all the peoples.
Let them praise Your great and awesome nameâ€”He is holy!
The mighty King loves justice. You have established equity; You have exercised justice and righteousness in Jacob.
Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at His footstool; He is holy!
Moses and Aaron were among His priests; Samuel was among those who called on His name. They called to the LORD and He answered.
He spoke to them from the pillar of cloud; they kept His decrees and the statutes He gave them.
O LORD our God, You answered them. You were a forgiving God to them, yet an avenger of their misdeeds.
Exalt the LORD our God and worship at His holy mountain, for the LORD our God is holy.
