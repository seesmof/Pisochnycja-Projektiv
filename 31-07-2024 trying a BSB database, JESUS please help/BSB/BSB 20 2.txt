My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,
if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,
if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,
if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,
then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.
For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.
He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,
to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.
Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equityâ€”every good path.
For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.
Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,
to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,
from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,
from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,
whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.
It will rescue you from the forbidden woman, from the stranger with seductive words
who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.
For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.
None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.
So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.
For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;
but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.
