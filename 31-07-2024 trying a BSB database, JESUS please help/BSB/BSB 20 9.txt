Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.
She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.
She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city.
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.
“Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed.
Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.”
He who corrects a mocker brings shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man taints himself.
Do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.
Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
For through wisdom your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.
If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.
The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.
She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,
calling out to those who pass by, who make their paths straight.
“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.
“Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is tasty!”
But they do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
