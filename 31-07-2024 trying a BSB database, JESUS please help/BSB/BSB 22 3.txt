On my bed at night I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him.
I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and squares. I will seek the one I love. So I sought him but did not find him.
I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city: “Have you seen the one I love?”
I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held him and would not let go until I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the chamber of the one who conceived me.

Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from all the spices of the merchant?
Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty of the mightiest men of Israel.
All are skilled with the sword, experienced in warfare. Each has his sword at his side prepared for the terror of the night.
King Solomon has made his carriage out of the timber of Lebanon.
He has made its posts of silver, its base of gold, its seat of purple fabric. Its interior is inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.
Come out, O daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown his mother bestowed on the day of his wedding—the day of his heart’s rejoicing.
