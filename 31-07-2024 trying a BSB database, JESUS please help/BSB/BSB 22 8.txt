O that you were to me like a brother who nursed at my motherâ€™s breasts! If I found you outdoors, I would kiss you, and no one would despise me.
I would lead you and bring you to the house of my mother who taught me. I would give you spiced wine to drink, the nectar of my pomegranates.
His left hand is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.
Who is this coming up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? I roused you under the apple tree; there your mother conceived you; there she travailed and brought you forth.
Set me as a seal over your heart, as a seal upon your arm. For love is as strong as death, its jealousy as unrelenting as Sheol. Its sparks are fiery flames, the fiercest blaze of all.
Mighty waters cannot quench love; rivers cannot sweep it away. If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, his offer would be utterly scorned.
We have a little sister, and her breasts are not yet grown. What shall we do for our sister on the day she is spoken for?
If she is a wall, we will build a tower of silver upon her. If she is a door, we will enclose her with panels of cedar.
I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers. So I have become in his eyes like one who brings peace.
Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-hamon. He leased it to the tenants. For its fruit, each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver.
But my own vineyard is mine to give; the thousand shekels are for you, O Solomon, and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit.
You who dwell in the gardens, my companions are listening for your voice. Let me hear it!
Come away, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.
