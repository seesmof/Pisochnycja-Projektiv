In that day you will say: “O LORD, I will praise You. Although You were angry with me, Your anger has turned away, and You have comforted me.
Surely God is my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid. For the LORD GOD is my strength and my song, and He also has become my salvation.”
With joy you will draw water from the springs of salvation,
and on that day you will say: “Give praise to the LORD; proclaim His name! Make His works known among the peoples; declare that His name is exalted.
Sing to the LORD, for He has done glorious things. Let this be known in all the earth.
Cry out and sing, O citizen of Zion, for great among you is the Holy One of Israel.”
