When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.
But the more I called Israel, the farther they departed from Me. They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to carved images.
It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them in My arms, but they never realized that it was I who healed them.
I led them with cords of kindness, with ropes of love; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.
Will they not return to the land of Egypt and be ruled by Assyria because they refused to repent?
A sword will flash through their cities; it will destroy the bars of their gates and consume them in their own plans.
My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He will by no means exalt them.
How could I give you up, O Ephraim? How could I surrender you, O Israel? How could I make you like Admah? How could I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassion is stirred!
I will not execute the full fury of My anger; I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim. For I am God and not man—the Holy One among you—and I will not come in wrath.
They will walk after the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.
They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.
Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.
