Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds.
After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.
So let us knowâ€”let us press on to know the LORD. As surely as the sun rises, He will appear; He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth.

Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with footprints of blood.

In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim practices prostitution there, and Israel is defiled.
Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore My people from captivity.
