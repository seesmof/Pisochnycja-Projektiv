From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,
saying: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice.
For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me; all Your breakers and waves swept over me.
At this, I said, ‘I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’
The waters engulfed me to take my life; the watery depths closed around me; the seaweed wrapped around my head.
To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God!
As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.
Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.
But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!”
And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
