This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble task.
An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
not dependent on wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, and free of the love of money.
An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity.
For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God?
He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the devil.
Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the snare of the devil.
Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued or given to much wine or greedy for money.
They must hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
Additionally, they must first be tested. Then, if they are above reproach, let them serve as deacons.
In the same way, the women must be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in all things.
A deacon must be the husband of but one wife, a good manager of his children and of his own household.
For those who have served well as deacons acquire for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these things
in case I am delayed, so that you will know how each one must conduct himself in Godâ€™s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
By common confession, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in throughout the world, was taken up in glory.
