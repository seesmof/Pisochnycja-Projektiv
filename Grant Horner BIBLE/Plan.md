We must have 10 checkboxes
Whenever we click some checkbox we determine to which group it belongs 
Near each checkbox we must have it's group last chapter
We first start with first chapters of each list 
On checkbox tick we check what is the last Book 
For that we somehow need to remember the last Book and chapter for each group
For this we can store a separate array with each list number and Book name and chapter number for it
