## About

This repository contains all of my less serious projects. Those vary from simple components to projects where I learn some new technology. Pretty much anything that cannot go into production or just me messing around with some code just for practice or fun. Made with React, TailwindCSS and NextJS. Fully functional, fully responsive.
